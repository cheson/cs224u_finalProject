THIS IS NOT THE BEGINNING
       Once upon a time two or three weeks ago, a rather stubborn and determined middle-aged man decided to record for posterity, exactly as it happened, wordby word and step by step, the story of another man for indeed what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal, a somewhat paranoiac fellow unmarried, unattached, and quite irresponsible, who had decided to lock himself in a room a furnished room with a private bath, cooking facilities, a bed, a table, and at least one chair, in New York City, for a year365 days to be precise, to write the story of another person—a shy young man of about 19 years old—who, after the war the Second World War, had come to America the land of opportunities from France under the sponsorship ofhis uncle—a journalist, fluentin five languages—who himself had come to America from Europe Poland it seems, though this was not clearly established sometime during the war after a series of rather gruesome adventures, and who, at the end of the war, wrote to the father his cousin by marriage of the young man whom he considered as a nephew, curious to know if he the father and his family had survived the German occupation, and indeed was deeply saddened to learn, in a letter from the young man—a long and touching letter written in English, not by the young man, however, who did not know a damn word of English, but by a good friend ofhis who had studied English in school—that his parents both his father and mother and his two sisters one older and the other younger than he had been deported they were Jewish to a German concentration camp Auschwitz probably and never returned, no doubt having been exterminated deliberately X * X * X * X, and that, therefore, the young man who was now an orphan, a displaced person, who, during the war, had managed to escape deportation by working very hard on a farm in Southern Prance, would be happy and grateful to be given the opportunity to come to America that great country he had heard so much about and yet knew so little about to start a new life, possibly go to school, learn a trade, and become a good, loyal citizen.
       Now the first person the stubborn and determined middle-aged man simply wanted to record, to the best ofhis ability and as objectively as possible, but for reasons that were never clearly stated man is indeed inexplicable, the activities of the second person the irresponsible paranoiac fellow, who, incidentally, was also an inveterate gambler as he planned—the day before he was to enter the room this is important—projected, calculated, and determined what he would need in the room for 365 days such as food, toilet articles, writing material, and so on, in order to survive and write the story of the young man who had come to America from France by boat and who had had such a rough time during the war and was now an orphan. Basically, this did not present any major problems for the first person since he was merely to be the recorder, the designer, the scribbler as it were of the second person’s story, though it should be pointed out immediately that this first person had very little experience in such matters, and that, in fact, he was a poor recorder, a lousy designer, a weak scribbler, and that on top of that he was a very bad typist, but, and that is the essential in matters such as these, he was stubborn and determined. For him, therefore, it was simply a matter of keeping track of, and keeping up with the activities, thoughts, decisions, and indecisions of the second person however incoherent these might be as he the second person noodled around if one may use such an expression—the day before he was to enter the room, this should be emphasized—in order to ascertain what he would need in the room besides the bed, the table, and the one chair to survive, while at the same time organizing conditionally of course in his mind and eventually on paper the elements of the story he wanted to write about the shy young man who was so inexperienced in the American-way-of-life, and decide also how he was going to compose and write that story in some coherent and artistic form. In other words, for the first person, it was just a matter of patience and determination, a matter, so to speak, of being able to keep up with the second person, and
 of course, this is understood, of trying to be as faithful and as precise as possible in his recording of the second person’s activities, however messed up, screwed up, chaotic these might be, for indeed, as it was once said: “One must have chaos in one to give birth to a dancing star.” Or better still: “What but an imperfect sense of humor could have made such a mess of chaos.”
        As for the second person, the one who suffers of paranoia, the gambler, the one who has decided to lock himself in the room for 365 days, his task is much more difficult than that of the first person. First of all, he has to establish some sort of schedule for his creative activities, and then he has to plan carefully the details ofhis survival in the room, and this with rather limited means the sum of approximately 1200 dollars and some change which—and this is never to be clarified—he has won gambling in Los Angeles or Los Vegas, he has possibly stolen, borrowed, or perhaps even saved—penny by penny—though the last is quite unlikely and furthermore, he has to invent and tell of course the story of the young man, word by word and step by step, describing, for instance, in detail and obviously realistically, the journey across the Atlantic Ocean, the love affair the young man had on the boat with a girl from Milwaukee, the arrival of the boat in New York, the encounter of the young man with his uncle on the pier he had never met his uncle before, the subway ride with his suitcase and his uncle in what can be called The Belly of America as they went from the pier to the Bronx to visit a Jewish family possibly relatives of the uncle who then asked them to stay for dinner, and beyond that everything else that will or may happen to the young man dining his first year in America. Originally, the second person ^thought he would cover the first five years of the young man’s life in America, but eventually, for obvious reasons man is indeed unpredictable, he decided to limit himself to the first year only so as to have “the time of the story” correspond "to his 365 days in the room” why this should be so will probably
never be clarified, particularly the period in Detroit where the uncle took his nephew after a few days sight-seeing in New York City. His problems the second person, the inventor, the noodler are, in a sense, double because he has to work out mentally and physically all the details of what he needs in the room within the limits of his rather limited means, and at the same time invent, or at least organize in one way or another, the details of what he is going to write once he has locked himself in the room—assuming of course he can find the kind of room he needs on the basis of his limited budget. Moreover, what makes his situation more difficult, more critical, is that he plans the whole thing, the whole undertaking, on the 30th of September, that is to say the day before he is to enter the room he has decided that he will enter the room on October 1st, and that nothing—yes, nothing—will interfere with his plans, for indeed there are too many men who scatter words in advance of their deeds, and always do less than they promise, but not him. The only way then he can possibly solve this complex double problem is to start at the beginning, deal with the question of the room first, and then keep going, as best and as fast as he can, with all the other details of his survival: food, toilet articles, writing material, and so on, and the elements of the story he wants to write; but most important, in order for him to succeed, is to avoid at all cost talking about his own life, or better yet to forget about himself completely at least until he and his invention converge and merge, so as to better concentrate on the life of the young man who, certainly, has had a much more interesting life than the second person. In other words, for the second person, the unattached, paranoiac, irresponsible gambler, it is a matter of coping in spite ofhis paranoia with the difficult ,|gnd critical task he has undertaken, for he knows that he loses nothing nothing! when he loses his time or his life.
        Now the third person, the young man who is going to come to America from France and who is very shy and Jewish and naive, he does not have anything to do at first except wait
 for the second person to get started with his story, wait and see how he is going to be invented, told, composed, and eventually written as he and his story unfold during his first year in America. All he has to do, in fact, is submit to the second person’s imagination and sense of organization as he the inventor invents, projects, organizes, composes, and eventually writes everything that will happen to him. His only concern, therefore, is to be created artistically, or better yet to be granted a role a meaningful role in this intramural setup, to be described coherently by the second person, and to some extent to be scribbled precisely, recorded faithfully, and so on, by the first person, though it should be pointed out here that this first person had no intention of interfering orally, physically, manually with the activities of the second person. However, if eventually, for personal reasons man is indeed free to choose his own destiny, free to propose and dispose, the third person the shy young man is not satisfied with the way the second person is writing him, or what he is saying about him and by simple extension how the first person is recording him, then he might quite possibly disagree with him, argue with him, and even try to convince him to change the way his story is being told, shaped, written and beyond that scribbled, designed, and recorded. For indeed the speed of thought is not superior to that of speech! But all this is, of course, strictly hypothetical since the young man very unsure of himself has really no voice, at least initially—ultimately he may have a partial voice—in the activities of the second person but none that’s quite obvious, in the recordings of the first person. In other words, he is nothing in the double setup, the interplay between the first and second person; as a matter of fact, unless the second person invents him, and the first person records him, he will never become anything, he will always remain non-existent a blob in somebody’s imagination, and of course neither the girl from Milwaukee, nor the uncle, nor the girl in the subway, nor the Jewish family in the Bronx, nor any of the other people who
 might have entered into the story, nor anything else that would have happened to him the poor young man during his first year in America will ever be told
                               scribbled
                                          written
                                                   and
recorded.
Therefore.
It is essential indeed that the second person allows nothing to interfere with his plans however irresponsible these might be, and that the first person persists in his stubborn and determined recording, and that finally the third person do nothing, nothing but wait to see what will happen to him and to the others who are involved with him.
Meanwhile.
A short double poetic statement might be in order at this point:
                  Reflection
                  Forging
                  with my his hands
                  from the experiences
                  of my his skin
                  a mask for reality
                  Carving
                  in my his bones
                  a meaning for life
                  I he heard something whispered
                  and my his fingers burned
                  at the touch of flesh
                  Quickly
                  I he denied the dreams of my his father .                   reshaped my his memories
                  to convenient usage and stood almost a winner Slowly
                  settling into lethargy when a clumsy gesture destroyed the illusion.
Now some people might say that this situation is not very encouraging but one must reply that it is not meant to encourage those who say that.
                                                                                       t
                                                                                   e
And this is why (he first person —                                                  v
                                           the recorder                             o
                                           the scribbler                            b
                                        the middleaged man, as established a simply sat down one day two or three weeks ago and started recording—as best he could—the activities of the second person and kept at it full speed, scribbling faithfully
           stubbornly and exactly as it happened                           step
                                                                             by
                                                                              step
everything that person was doing, saying, thinking, planning, calculating, organizing, inventing, composing, anticipating, projecting, writing, etc., even though much of it appeared totally incoherent, illogical, gratuitous, fragmented, all loused up, messed up, zero, irrational, unreadable, irresponsible, unpublishable, full of errors, bad, etc.
Nevertheless
the first person recorded it all, as it was, as it were, as it happened.
                                                                               t
                                                                           e
                                                                           v
While                                                                       o
the second person struggled, day after day, to solve                        b
                                                  to resolve, as pointed out a this double problem simultaneously and with very limited means on hand since and this will be clarified eventually before locking himself in the room to write the story of the not-yet-invented third person who was to come soon to America from France he had to cope with the preparation— if one may use that term—of his survival in the room while at the same TIME think                           ahead
                                       plan
                                 calculate
                                 anticipate - and so on - what he was going t ■tr-              WOULD  UP SET    WHOLE THE ELSE OR ABOUT WRITE O
                 fall a—part                                     ^------------
                 be use—less &hope—less
                 & make him feel even more paranoiac than before & forever & ever
>
 Therefore the best thing for him to do was to start at the beginning wherever that might be allow nothing to interfere with his plans and keep going however incoherent irrational all screwed up and so on what he was doing became for indeed as an inveterate gambler that he was why should he be ashamed when the dice or the cards fall in his favor and why should he ask himself am I a dishonest player since from the beginning he is willing to succumb if not immediately at least eventually for indeed having decided on the 30th of September the day after he arrived in New York City by bus from Los Angeles or some other place with what was left ofhis original 1200 dollars or so to lock himself in a room the next day October 1st he had very little time indeed to get the room and all the things he needed in the room to survive and compose the damn story he wanted to write ready on time and at the same time decide what he was going to write how he was going to write and finish eventually the story of the young man and what that story would be all about while obviously the young man whose story was going to be written and recorded though not yet written and recorded or for that matter not even invented had nothing to do but wait and see what would happen to him and to his life when he arrived in America screwed the beautiful girl from Milwaukee on the boat met his old uncle on the pier went with him by subway to the Bronx and on the way sat across from a beautiful tall and slim black girl whose legs were widely spread apart so that he got all excited and by the time he arrived with his uncle at the apartment of the Jewish people he and his uncle were visiting in the Bronx he locked himself in the bathroom down the corridor a few minutes after they arrived to jerk off a good one feeling sorry for himself wondering sadly what would happen to him as he waited to see how he and his story were going to develop be handled by the secondpersonbis creator his maker and finally how the first person would record them artistically for posterity, etc. etc. etc.
this then is how it all started at the beginning just like that once upon a time two or three weeks ago with the first person recording what the second person was doing as he planned the way he was going to lock himself for one year in a room to write the story of the third person all of them ready anxious to be to go to exist to invent to write to record to survive to become
 It all began at the beginning:   stubbornly and determinedly on the part of
                                   the first person             number one
                                  paranoiacally and confusedly on the part of the second person          number two
                                  shylyandwithsomereservations on the part of the third person            number  three
 I tall started just before number twoantzKd the room theday before to beexact when he said to himself:         just think... for instance...
                                   just like that!
                                   A very simple straightforward statement which was immediately recorded by number one while number three awaited his fate in the hollow ofhis fate not thinking or saying anything at all. From that point on number two was on his own:
 just think... fir instance...
 That’s exacdy what was thought exacdy                           said
        exacdy                 written
        exactly               recorded
 For indeed the three of them agreed:
        Here all is clear...No all is not clear... But the discourse must go on... So one invents obscurities... Rhetoric
 It should be noted here that overlooking the whole intramural setup described in the preceding pages obviously there has to be a fourth person Someone to control organize supervise if yovwish the activities and relations of the other three persons Someone who can keep things going in an orderly manner who can resolve arguments smooth out difficulties Someone who is like a father or like a supervisor but not necessarily likeaninventor The secondperson is the inventor nor like a recorder That function belongs to the first person And of course not like aprotagonist The third person will fit into that role eventually But someone who can be called an overall looker who hasno creativepower ofhis own but who is simply here and no t here above aside beside and of course underneath the whole set up and who is to a great extent responsible and not responsible for what is going on and what is going to go on and therefore even though he may or may not be real and may never be heard and his presence neverfeltnonetheless is implied andimplicitinthediscourse Or else the question can be asked how is unity created between the three persons involved in this story which is about to begin if someone is not hidden somewhere in the background omnipresent omnipotent and omniscient to control directdictate abehavior to the three other unfortunate beings And of course to write and present the preceding pages which obviously cannot possibly have been written by any of the three persons involved in what will follow shortly that is to say the real fictitious discourse now to begin.

8 DOLLARS A WEEK THEN IT WILL HAVE TO BE NOODLES NOODLES THEN IT IS IMAGINE
Noodles too
Noodles                     by themselves: a complete food
                               —contains all sorts of good things—
But the room of course is more important though
                                 a room without food is useless with a large window with                        a view
that's essential.
Who gives a damn about the garbage cans in the yard and the grey sky.                                                        No!
                                                           Ridiculous!

that's better.
So many rooms all over many without views but this time it's different:
         8 bucks a week for a room
         6         that's what it should be
                   that's what it was the last time          No! 9
         52 times 6 makes only 312
                                 312 for a room almost half almost human              not quite
A room not just a room to sleep in to take craps in jerk off in hide in feel sorry for yourself in a room with a meaning to sleep in only when you're tired.
                      Eventually a symbol: [R
                      A working room and a piece of blue sky perhaps                    without the room
                                                  it's useless hopeless
particularly at times like these.

Who cares about the furniture
                                                as long as there's a chair and a table a working table
                                              a table to work on of course the wall paper is important too.
                 So many crummy wall papers in one's life:

What a stroke of luck after all these years. Here it goes:
                         Double or Nothing!
 Could have lost your pants did you think of that?
 It’s obvious
 Surely one thinks of that quickly anybody would. And living it up now
                                                               living the time of noodles.
 Could call it that:       A Time of Noodles
                           A Time of Macaroni          !
 Noodles is better simply noodles that’s not bad better in French though when they translate it Le TempsDesNouilles wouldn’t do it myself.

                 put the date on the first page one never knows that’s for sure:
 —  How long did you work on it? They’ll ask for sure.
 —  One year.
 —  Only a year!
    Just about. 365 days to be exact got to be precise.
 —  Remarkable! Unbelievable! Only, a year! That’s the way to go.
 —  Yes...
  Yes. You see only 365 boxes...It’s not unusual...You see Stendhal wrote La Chartreuse De Parrne in 63 days that’s something.. .Think it was 63 or maybe it was 66... At least that’s what they claim...
  —  Who?
     Who cares!
  October 1st and goodbye world goodbye people society and the little guy in the street and the big guy in the big room and all the rest goodbye fresh air in the street in the parks in the country in we go
                               go ahead.
            Could call it            A State of Siege

                               Almost the same. No got to start before that.

            He’s got to think ahead be afraid a little anticipate with
            apprehension the worst but hope for the best
            It’s foggy in New York that morning you know the kind of
            grey fog that gets you after a while the kind that drips from
            everything like soapy water from everywhere the land that
            makes you say whatafuckingweather

            own shy way he’s about 19
  ^Tomorrow morning that’s it you enter into the nights of your skull somebody has to do it into the chambers of the mind just like that no kidding it has to be told straight through without tears the truth because one can never expose only that which at a certain moment can become present can manifest itself that which can show itself present itself as a present a being-present in its truth the truth of a present or the presence of the present correct                     therefore

 a pound a day one pound daily of that enriched product should be plenty enough at least enough to survive on top of the wall before falling into the huge white hole feet first with the bugs and the flying horses and the chair by the window
 365 pounds — then
 365 one pound boxes.                       Incredible!
 Get boxes of course it’s better

      Would be funny as hell though if the whole damn thing the whole damn batch the whole damn stock the whole damn pile went bad after a couple of weeks a few months let’s say two or three months and you have to quit
                                     Everything spoils

                                                        So many guys starving in the world!
But there are so many ways to cook potatoes a guy can really get confused go mad mashed French fried boiled potato salad yes but then you need oil and vinegar doesn’t matter much and anyway can’t waste too much time peeling the damn things and could
never decide how to cook them agreed on noodles noodles it is Love noodles adore noodles have apassion for noodles and they keep well too easily a year if not more also
                                              you cook the whole box in the morning for the whole day one cooking per day and you have breakfastlunch and dinner in one pot over and done and up
even cold they’re not bad                     takes  only  a minute to warm up
Every moment
Every minute will count can’t waste a moment
                                                                     a minute
Should be able to work at least 12 hours a day even more: 15 or 17 at times like these one must push a little:
                                              12 hours a day minimum
                                              7 days a week maximum
                                              No Sundays
                                                  Sundays are for proletarians.
12 times 7 miniimum that’s 84 hours a week

Definitely.      The period in Detroit is important. Describe how he worked—48 hours
                a week in those days—in the factory: Chrysler that’s the place what a joint!—Hands literally bleeding even with gloveson canvas gloves. Every detail counts: got to think about every detail
                                              No butter though too expensive and anyway it wouldn’t keep no even if there is a refrigerator in the room no t all places have one
Doesn’t matter. Only one chair. In time the table will move by the window. That’s where the work will be done. 10 pages a day? That’s a little less than a page an hour if you work 12 hours a day minimum that’s already a lot.
Would be easier and simpler and more logical to do one page an hour
if only to keep track         12 pages a day. 365 days.
                               12 times           365 doesn’t make sense at this
                                                    time
Some days will be better than others Some days will be blank Some days will be tremendous
But most important you’ve got to keep going
                                                    The whole thing depends on that The whole thing is settled then

                                           tomato sauce to add flavor tomato sauce on Sundays

evidently no weeks either after a while you won’t even know which week which day which month it is for sure won ’ t even know if it’s night orday particularly if you decide work with the curtains closed, in the chambers of night I didn ’ t consider that yet but it’s a possibility
  all alone
  alone with my 365 boxes alone with my 365 days
                                               RUN OUT OF BOXES RUN OUT OF DAYS
  It’s like a guy in jail or on an island carving the days on the wall or on a piece of wood with a knife with anything a fork with his teeth Robinson Crusoe of the Noodles but in this case it’s different it’s backwards diminishing rather than augmenting the boxes that is not the days when there’ll be no more boxes you’ll know then it’s the end end of the year The guy in jail he’s stuck unless of course he knows when he’s coming out but if he’s serving for life if he’s a murderer or a sex maniac then in his case it’s hopeless Don’t un             derstand why he goes
  on carving the days                on the wall unless he’s
  just faking it Didn’t              think of that But if he’s
  a thief a petty thief              serving only for a few
  months then he has a               right to go on carving
  on the wall unless of              course he doesn’t have
  anything with which                to carve except his fin
  gernails or else unless            he doesn’t want to carve
  That’s his business                Nobody is forcing him
  But the other guy on               the island he can’t give
  up For him it’s a dif              ferent matter than for
  the guy in jail There’s            always a boat in the
  back of his carving or             something like a boat a
  submarine a seaplane a destroyer unless that's quite possible he decides instinctively to carve a boat a canoe in a tree instead of carving days on a crummy piece of wood Though the guy may very well decide to do both There are guys like that idiots who always do everything *the hard way But it’s his decision Nobody is telling him what to do on his deserted island unless of course there are cannibals on his ass then the carving serves a double purpose on the one hand to save his life on the other to escape alive It may be double work but eventually it pays
  it’s double or nothing and also it permits him to keep
 track of the number of days he’s been on the island as well as the number of days it takes him to carve single-handed his lifesaving boat Of course the number of days may never coincide but at least it gives a meaning to the carving But if the cannibals are after his ass then defi nitely it might be better for the poor guy to forget about counting the days he’s been on the island and concentrate on his boat in order to get the hell out of there or else instead of ending in             the boat he ends in the
 pot it all works out only        if he has marked the
 day he began the carv            ing of the boat because
 then things don’t really work out or else they do depending on how much the guy values his life But carving for carving’s sake the guy on an island is better off than the guy in jail That’s for sure He has more wood and more room too But in either case the trick is never to give up and ^pever count the days That would solve the whole thing But can they do it Can anybody with a common sense of time do it The trick is to swear in advance never to count the days though it’s always possible to count something else The pages for instance when a guy is writing
a guy on an island boat the first day First few weeks before something like a boat out of there But after a guy’s temperament with the scenery he starts carving the boat eady started carving course the cannibals
           never begins carving a he waits a few days a starting hoping that will show up to get him while depending on the and how fed up he is gives up hoping and But he may have air the days unless of got to him before that
                                                         Swear cross your heart and spit on the floor never to count the boxes:
                                                                 that
                                                                                                                          wouldbe

 Only towards the end
 it'll be inevitable when there is only one box left then you can't avoid counting one box
                                  or even two or seven
 It's self-evident.
                        For sure then you'll know how many days are left
                                                                 unavoidably
                        But definitely at the beginning and most of the time             avoid at all cost counting the boxes

  do you realize how many hours that makes: four thousand three hundred
                                                                                                                  and eighty hours ! ! ! !

Some guys say that the more you do it the easier it gets but other guys say that the more you do it the harder it gets comes out the same in the end most important however is to get going and keep going quickly stubbornly
                                                                   regularly

                                            and no fucking around I’ll start on the boat. Just
  before he arrives in New York.
                                      Would be nice to have the Statue of Liberty in the background very symbolic. He meets a girl on the boat the first day. An American girl from Milwaukee Mary. That’s a good name. She spent the summer in Europe.
  Typical American girl:               blondish
                                      cute
                                      sexy
                                      enormous ass but not too much. Just right
  ^Xhey have an affair/ a love affair/ that’s easy on a boat/ he screws her once or twice in her cabin/ no/ he doesn ’t screw her/ he is too shy/ and also she won’t let him/ just a romance/ nothing more/ the sort of things that always happen on boats/ yes/ she is willing but she is afraid to do it/ and besides she shares her cabin with another girl/ and he has no cabin/he’s in the big hole/
 you know where they shove 20 or 30 guys/ together/ and it stinks like hell/ and anyway she shares her cabin with another girl/ a fat American girl from Chicago/ so they can’t get in/ that’s not unusual/ one often sees things like that on a boat/but on deck/the upper deck/atnight they bring ablanket and mess around/of course/he thinks he is in love with her/the two of them are so young/he is 19 or so/ she hasn’t told him her age but it’s obvious she’s about 19 too/ and it’s really the first time he gets involved/ temporarily/ with such a fine girl/ before that only pigs/ in Paris/ and she seems to like him too/ at least that’s what she tells him/ naive the two of them/ naive like hell/ and it’s only the beginning/ wait till you see what happens to them/
 Should be able to write at least a dozen pages on that evenmore if you go into all sorts of details: description of the boat—the clothes both of them wear—the mood they are in—the messing around on the deck — the color of the blanket and of the sky—and all the crap she tells him about America— and all the crap he tells her about himself. Tremendous. Easily 12 pages. Formidable.
 She tells him all about America:          What a great place
                                           How he’s going to like it How lucky he is How richhe’s going to be How famous he’s going to be How tremendous things will be What a great place etc. etc. etc.
 He believes every word she says:          He’s so scared It’s natural And
 She’s such a nice girl and she has a bit of college French that helps a bit She thinks she understands him and tries to reassure him typically American and she tells him

 ♦fis uncle is waiting on the pier almost forgot the uncle
 —  the boat should dock soon — in spite of the weather —
 Meanwhile
She goes on and on       What a girl!:
                    Your uncle will meety ou at the boat with his car— even threw that in. I can see the whole scene already and maybe you’ll cry a little and your uncle and me too and well keep in touch and
I promise to come and see you in Detroit and we’ll write to each other yes regularly and you’ll see what a great place and you’ll forget the past
I am sure that’s a good one. You are so lucky. Everything will be nice everything will be for the future and so on what a girl!
12 more pages on that
Yes.       But.. .he squeezes in afew words here and there.. .1 never
         met my uncle doesn’t matter.. .1 don’t even know how he looks...He never sent his picture...I sent him one of mine in color that’s the way to go — it’s obvious—3 more pages...
Yes.    He just wrote after the war not to me but to my father you see
         he’snotreallymy unclehe’smyfather’scousin No! Imeanhe’s a cousin by marriage He married a cousin of my father I think that’s why he wrote to him after the war to my father just to see what had happened but but since he was not there anymore my father I mean you know since he was dead I read the letter I mean I didn’t really read it it was in English I had someone who studied English a good friend read it to me that’s important he doesn’t speak a damn word of English. Therefore all that in French. I’ll translate later
Yes. While Mary is shaking her head approvingly and af fectionately—too bad he didn’t screw her she needed it. Typical American girl. Easily 12pages. Then after a while my uncle started sending me packages: food canned food candies cigarettes.
Yes.    he sent me a lot of cigarettes American cigarettes: Luckies

Definitely. Describe the clothes they are wearing. It’ll make a nice contrast.
Absolutely. Yes. This tie I’ve gpt on and the socks and also a beautiful green sweater in my suitcase they are from America. American clothes. My unclesent them to me. Also I used to collect thestamps, from all the letters and packages that?s a nice cultural touch, and then
              I would sell them at thestamp market on the Champs Elys&s yes what a memory.
              Yes.

                                                                      he asked ifl wanted to come to America: Whatwould you have done?
                                                  What could I do?
                                                  Whatwould you have done?
                                                  What could I do?
                                                                                      These are the kinds of questions he asks all the time so many questions and no answers!
But once you get him started he goes on and on getting everything all mixed up:
          You know it was not easy to decide all that in French of course—he doesn’t speak a word of English exceptfir a few words here and there hepicked up on the boat I'tkeYzsNo Good Morning Sorry Goodbye Sonofabitch but u-n-b-e-l-i-e-v-a-b-l-e the way hepronounces them Lucky Mary speaks French she studied in college a year or so and after a whole summer in France she has improved tremendously— must be a rich girl to be able to afford a whole summer in France—a bit older than he is too and more intelligent but no complex no mother complex that is. You know it
          was not easy at allyou see I have an aunt that*s on his mother’s side who lives in Africa that’s right in Dakar and she wanted me to come there and livewith her shehas some kind ofbigbusiness yes a bighoteloxA shewanted me to come and work after the war with her in her big hotel or something like that and she wrote after I knew I was an orphan not to his father therefore but to him this time along letter addressed to me personally in French but
                                         But your uncle will take good care of you she cuts right in. You’ll see he’ll send you to school unbelievable that girl to 1 earn English that’s essential in America. In America everybody goes toschool everybody speaks English too. You’ll be happy. You’ll see life in America is quite different than
                                      Than                     all that crap!
If I start out on the boat like that should be able to move fast with Mary.
Three boxes of noodles and I’ll have the whole scene................a dozen cups of
coffee.
Coffee:             let’s get that going— 26 jars
                                               79  cents a jar on sale that’s a lot of jars man —
                    But everything has to be ready in advance. One never knows. Suppose those bastards decide to raise theprice of things in the middleof theyear just like that for no reason at all. Inflation and all that crap. What a society! Doesn’t matter of course since you’ll have the whole stock ready in advance but another guy would really be fucked ifhe didn’t have his whole stock ready in advance and right in the middle of theyear they decide to raise the prices of everything just like that. Even a penny here and there can fuck up the whole system. That’s the advantage of planning ahead.
                    One has to:                 26 times 79 makes 20.04

                  Expensive that shit when you think of it but essential.
                  Could round it off to 20 even—20 bucks—ridiculous that extra 4 cents that zero four that little decimal 4
                  If I start like that on the boat and keep going things begin to add up. Should make a list perhaps a list:
                  Noodles Tomato Sauce Coffee
                  Toothpaste
Sure               ................
                  Toothpaste              A guy’s got to brush everyday
                                           if not you get a lousy taste in the                     mouth!
Here we go then: how many squeezes in a tube of toothpaste?
A great deal depends on the number of squeezes in a tube—regular size—who ever thought of that—I refuse to buy family size—they look bigger the tubes but it’s a fake in fact it’s an illusion the family size—finally they leave too much space—empty space—at the top and at the bottom too—those bastards—you think you get more for your money a bigger tube a better buy for only a buck 19 or something but in the end you don’t even have more squeezes—you squeeze air—an illusion—same thing with all the other junk they sell family size—hair lotion shampoo hand lotion talcum powder after shaving lotion—all that shit you rub on yourself—same crummy deal—an illusion a stinking
                                           illusion.
But you’ve got to brush:             I knew a guy who refused to brush everyday.
                                What a mess twenty years later. It’suseless if you want my real opinion. Doesn’t even pay to talk about it.
Minimum once a day:                   Family size! A joke! You’re damn right. An
                                yway I’m not a family. I refuse to be taken in. They see you coming and immediately they assume you’re a father and there you are helpless here they go shoving the family size at you.
 60 squeezes in a tube:       Regular size. Right! No! More than that! 80!
                              Give or take a bigger squeeze here and there a bigger squeeze one morning out of despair on the edge of the cliff going over in and out down the white bole. But you’ve got to brush. Damn right!
 75 cents for a regular tube: Cannot do without seriously. Once in the mor
                              ning that’s enough. Some guys are fanatics they do it twice a day or even after each meal three meals a day minimum. That’s pushing a bit. Deodorant fine. Never use the stuff and anyway deodorant that’s for other people that’s part of human relations human contacts. Alone in my roomsurrounded by my noodles there won’t be much indeed human relations. But toothpaste that’s indispensable.
 Colgate! Tastes better:     75centsforaregulartube.Thosemotherfuckers!
                              And then they have king size—extra long size— giant size. They push the damn sizes on you and after a while you’re like a midget in the midst of all that gigantic stuff. Gives you a complex. It’s as if they wanted to crush you kill you extermi nate you with all their sizes. And quick too.
 75 cents:                   No! They always make it 79—89—98—199
                              always just a penny or two under the next zero. That’s another one of their tricks. You think you’re paying less closer to 70 or 80 or 90 or 180 but in fact you’re closer to 80—90—a buck— 200. Same withnoodles cars bicycles televisions overcoats shoes refrigerators. You see the prices in big numbers: $2.98—$49.99—$228.98— $2498.99 and bang it costs you 3 bucks or 50 bucks or 230 bucks or 2500 bucks. Never fails.
 80 squeezes:                Like that suit I bought at Kleins’s. His first
 V-                          American suit. $48.98. With the 50 bucks I had
                              he didn’t even have enough for a tie. Kept wear ing the one his uncle sent him from America. But the socks they had big holes in them. That’s ironical. And the green sweater. He never wore the damn thing. Too green.
  I'll have to waste a tube counting squeezes.                   It's safer.
  Can't afford to overstock. What would I do with an extra dozen tubes
                              Regular size                          Colgate?
  At least the first three or four squeezes won't be wasted             I'll
  make them big ones                                          the first day. But that doesn't
  solve the problem: How many times can you brush in one day? ES * * H One tube shot to hell.            That stuff doesn't keep once C/**U
                                                                                                                         L**©
  you take it out.            That raises an enormous question: TLT * * 0
  How the hell do they get it in?        They must shove the stuff in with
  a spoon or something.             A shoving machine no doubt. Just
  imagine a guy spending his life 8 hours a day shoving toothpaste in a tube. What a disgusting business. I could have him work in a factory                   in    the beginning where they make
  tubes it's not unusual. Did it myself. What a system! Nobody would believe it.            No.  I'll find something better for
  him to to. I'll make a list of jobs he gets during that time first five years. That's the story. First five years in America. No that's too much. One year that's enough. Got to limit yourself a ^little.                          365 days to be exact                  12
  pages a day. I'll start on the boat                 Forget the factory for
  now.                              So many other things to think about
 : a name for instance.              Can't use his real name.              No
 No rush though the name can wait. First the toothpaste 80
 squeezes in a tube that makes 80 days once a day of course               365
 divided by 80 doesn't come out even - but a bigger squeeze here and
 there                  that7s 4 point 56 and something tubes for the year.
 Make it an even five.               Can't take a chance                   Or
 maybe            four.              Should be enough. Let's say five
 tubes for safety's sake. If I run short I'll cut down on the size of
 the squeezes towards the end. A guy's got to be practical. 79 cents?
 No!      79 that's the price of coffee.
          69                          ?         Then
          69 times 5 sorry that's $3.45 for toothpaste alone.
 Maybe I should start my list here and now or else it gets all confused.
 But      Toothpaste implies also
          Toothbrush obviously I have one now everybody does
          and not in bad condition but what's the life span of a toothbrush?
          Has-anyone-ever-considered-the-life-span-of-a-toothbrush-has-anyone?
          Good question. They say "replace after three months." Buthave they really been checked? Have they really and truly been examined? Have they really examined the question? The question of the toothbrush?
 ^Bought this one let's see? When was it? no! before before exactly before Los Angeles must have been unless it was? in Detroit yes no! or before Chicago?

            You get caught up with those damn factories and you can not escape any more even when they lay you off you go on looking for another job. It’s a vicious circle they must shove the stuff into the tubes withaspoon. Apileoflousy shitthat’sit that’s whatitis with aspoon or something like a spoon                                  Yes!

8 bucks a week for a room
that’s a lot of money when you think of it.
Especially for a room where you do nothing in it. I mean nothing serious yes nothing constructive.
Definitely then          You don’t give up      and besides
                      You can 'tgive up before starting.
Then you start all over:
first the room then the noodles then the coffee then the toothpaste.
That’s the way to go
   etc.
   Yes.

remembers how long a toothbrush lasts "When you bought it and how much it costs It happens one day just like that You decideyou need a new one but of course you just don’t rush out and buy it immediately on the spot First you consider You contemplate You think about it Hesitate the price the color The texture Do you really need a new one?

 After he gets off the boat in New York he spends a few days in New York with his uncle. Uncle George? Uncle Sam? Too obvious. Uncle Arthur? Theodore? Ted? Erskine? No good. Something more real...more human...moreunclish, David? That’s it! David! It’s a real good credible believable human name. And then.. .then after that they move on.. .to Detroit. That’s where the uncle David! lives and a few days later...just like that...he begins to work in the factory Chrysler!... About a week or ten days after he arrives he starts working... That’s about right.                                                    No, it’s not
 right! It won’t work. He’s got to learn some English first. Takes at least a whole month before you can even put a sentence together... At least in his case. For a guy who does not speak a word of English what else can he do? It’s the only thing hecan do.. .thefactory... In the beginning it should be tough for him.. .real tough to get ajob.. .to get anything.. .apiece of ass.. .afiiend.. .arecommendation.. .at least a week. A few weeks a month or even two or three.. .and.. .then of course there is loneliness despair homesickness and so on.. .but no suicidal tendencies. Not in the beginning... that’s too phony... too dramatic. A guy’s got to be careful.
 No sentimentality either. Got to tell it straight---------------------------

 The most difficult will be to find the right tone... In French it would be easier of course le tonjuste... Have him talk the whole time.. .as if he were telling his own story to somebody else to me for instance. Or simply remembering it...yes! That’s one way of doing it.. .even though it’s a bit restricting. No descriptions then. Just talk. Talk all the time. I only ... no he... And of course in English.
 ^Rastobe! No accent.. .that’s too contrived...we skip the accent... Just let him talk...talk...talk...for himself even if what he says does not make sense... : BLAblaBLAblaBLAblaBLAblaBLAblaBLAblaBLAblaBLAblaBLAbla :

                                                           procrastinating
You touch them You feel them You handle them all over Once I felt one for twenty-five minutes in a drugstore without even buying it The guy in the drugstore was looking at me as though I was some kind of a nut or something You touch the bristles the handles
          the little hole at the end of the handle         I have touched
them all Soft Medium Hard Stiff Curved How the hell do you know which one to choose              It’s excruciating and you can’t
                                                               you can’t
because the damn things are locked up in plastic cases and you’re not allowed to open the cases That’s for sure And besides you always think it’s useful at first when you pay for it but in the end there is no hope           They are useless those crummy little plastic
cases            Especially since you can never get the damn paper that’s
glued on them off              So you don’t feel the brush in any case it
          would not be sanitary           All you can do is feel the plastic
cases Feels good as a matter of fact Nice and smooth                  But
still you can’t make up your mind Toothbrushes always seem too expensive or else too cheap for what they are That’s a good point: The ones at 39 look too cheap
          The ones at 89 too expensive and the ones at 59 you can’t
                                                               trust
          Also they make some with plastic bristles Plastic my ass
          Never trust plasticity Never
          Also that’s another thing to consider the hard ones make
          your gums bleed They always say you have to brush UP
                                                             and D
         and never s-id-e-w-ay-s          That in itself is a goOd
                                                                           W
         Gould waste two or three boxes just on that alone! poiNt Skip it!
It’s like a game
         a game with very tricky rules a poker game let’s say Somewhere in Las Vegas or else in Los Angeles just to get away from the toothbrush.
Almost lost my pants you say game but who knows the game may have been rigged Doesn’t matter the money has to come from someplace Yours is gone Finished
         It breaks off between your teeth But you forget again
                                              What an obsession
         You remember the next morning even though it hurts
                                                            And here we go.
Finally you can’t take it any more
You rush out of the game You take off like a rabbit your pants down to buy the first one that looks decent Dr. SaAndSo
                                                             But finally
you’re never satisfied Too hard
                           Too soft
                                Next time I’ll play roulette you tell yourself what a mess!                Next time Til buy myself a medium one
you tell yourself A game
                           A game of course in L. A I remember now:
                       That’s what makes life bearable ^                      and to think of it
                           to talk about it
                           to get it off your chest helps
                                                       helps pass the time.
  What an obsession! Perhapslshouldhaveasecondoneinreserve one never knows once you’re in that’s it if I lose it I’m lost it won’t matter much win or lose I won’t be able to replace it no no extras that’s for sure and it can happen once
                                                    once I
                     knew a guy who lost his toothbrush in his room                          No Kidding!
  What a story! He spent three days straight looking for it. Three days. Imagine that. It was a yellow one. Of course he could have dropped the whole thing and gone out to buy another one. But not him. Not that stubborn sonofabitch. I can’t understand guys like that. He looked everywhere: under the b ed in the closets in the kitchen in the refrigerator in the stairs under the carpets in all his pockets. Itwas like a game.. .It became an obsession. I remember I came to visit him and he asked me to help. We looked all over: under the bed in the closets in the kitchen in the refrigerator in the stairs under the carpets in all our pockets. He looked in mine and I looked in his. Whatamaniac. Very friendly. He even asked me to take off my clothes to make sure. By then I was becoming very suspicious. No he said it’s just to make sure. Do not trust anybody. Some guys are real fanatics when it comes to their personal properties. And once you get Involved with them it’s damn hard to break off. Once <fr»you get started with something or somebody you’ve got to go on to the end. Things have to have a beginning and an end. Lucky for him he finally found it. We could have gone on like that for days and days. 365 days just looking for a lost toothbrush. All over the place.
And of all places in it off and use it again be like new No not waited for him in his it Didn’t matter much agreed withhim Then I had my own prob That's generosity for insisted For what the warmly but of course he wasn’t looking out he would have gone fallen in that mom the crummy tooth
thetoiletbowlYesWe But not him No not that guy He rushed room This time a red to me but why did he after we talked for a lems to think about you The yellow one damn thing was I didn’t keep it I threw of the window What a crazy Happens some ing after he brushed brush Maybe twenty
laughed like hell But that guy I told him out and bought him one Supposedly red is say misplace instead while I told him I had But before leaving he The one that had worth And also for it in the first garbage waste But lucky for times In the toilet his teeth Of course I bucks or something
that guy What a dumb that if he uses a self another one im easier to find He said of lose That’s really to go The poker game gave me his old tooth fallen in the toilet having wasted my can I saw down the him we found his bowl Imagine It’s in would have preferred would have been nice
guy I told him to wash strong detergent it’ll mediately while I in case you misplace something Finally I and all that I told him brush just like that bowl As a reward He time So I thanked him street making certain toothbrush otherwise credible Must have a bit of cash instead of for a beginning EVir the
reward The.money has to come from someplace Luck or no luck this is one possible version It happened one day in Los Angeles That
simplifies matters member But for the started Supposedly garbage Going West stumbled into this hesitated a moment pening to me I found looked very suspi here Losing a bit bucks and some loose brush and. the important Tell it the guys around the the idea came to me
Both the lost toothb record Assuming this after I threw the This was before the bunch of guys who or so and then said myself in some kind cious to me But what there But two hours change in front and twenty bucks the straight exactly table looked at me as YES I shouted
rush and the poker is a normal kind of toothbrush away I whole business immediately asked Trying to control my of crummy basement could a guy do That’s later approximately I beside me Suddenly freak guy didn’t how it happened I though I was some DOUBLE OR NOTE
game This way it’s discourse this then was walking towards about the noodles me if I wanted to play voice OK and before I playing poker with a how I got into the must have had dose Let’s forget about give me as areward shouted DOUBLE kind of nuts or some ING not thinking
much easier to re describes how it downtown past the Much before when I poker with them I knew what was hap bunch of guys who game Winning a bit Even more to 150 the yellow tooth This is much more OR NOTHING and all thing But that’s when about anything just
shoving all my dough Everything in the pot And hell with it all hell with it all hell with it all hell with it all

thegarbagecan... solraisedhim another 50 bucks... he flinched thatlittlepunk... hesitated... you could see that... mumbled something in his teeth. .. a dirty word... with a little twist of the mouth...
I raise you another 50 he finally saidjustlikethatlookingatmein the eyes... what a sonofabitch oh... I was sweating under the arms and in the crotch too... my jockies sticking to my balls... finally 1 pushed all the dough I had in front of me into the pot to see his hand... cool as a rabbit... on the surface but inside burning like hell... I was almost tempted to raise him another 50... takes guts... the kind of guts I don't have... that did it... I don't have to give all the details... all the emotions and reactions... after all it's only a game... but what a game... I'll use that exactly how the whole thing happened approximately. . .but firsthe'll have to be able to take it... he'll have to learn how to play because when he first arrives in America he's so dumb hedoesn'tevenknowhow to play poker... eventually I'll teach him... I'll make a gambler outofhim too... butin the beginning nothing... just as dumb as the guy with the-Flush......

                                Nothing literally nothing what a dumb guy it’s only later on that he learns the game but that redhead jeik he knew the game that’s for sure I really felt bad for him when I grabbed the big pot 5 or 6 hundred bucks so bad for that D poor jeik that I tdd him look here man I’ll give you an O other chance the whole bundle on the line in one U blow everything take it or leave it that’s generosity B for you he locked at me with a blank lock on his L face and then said ok and that’s how it happened E and of course I won with a lousy pair of jacks I believe so finally when I got out of the place I O must have had at least 12 or 13 hundred R bucks in my pocket but I’ll know for sure only when I make my grand total at N the end then I’ll know for sure bow O much I’m sup posed to have T won because the money has to H come from someplace but I if that’s not luck then I N don’t know yo u might say I G had it assumin g even now for the record that every time a guy speakshe tells a true story then this is how finally the game ended after I turned up my three deuces and grabbed the big pot it was then that I de cided to double up everything of course I didn’t say it aloud but I thought of it and I can still see the poor guy’s face when I said to him ok double or nothing his face was all green he might have pulled a knife on me or a gun or even a machine gun like in the movies after all we were not far from Hollywood you never know with guys like that but he didn’t move he simply mumbled something again what a mumbler and then he took a sip from his glass but funny thing ^ though everybody could see that his glass was empty yes they were serving drinks in that basement either he didn’t realize his glass was empty or else he made believe the poor sucker finally he got up and sort of shrugging his narrow shoulders he said see you around speaking to all the other guys I suppose certainly not tome directly because
 I was not going to be aroundvery long but stillhe said that unbelievable the things a guy says when he knows he’s had it and I am quoting only what he said not what probably was going on in his mind his narrow little mind that little jeik so many guys like that lousy louse losers it’s like the time on the boat just before the boat arrived in New York there was a guy playing poker and losing eveiything he had brought with him from the old country and still he wouldn’t quit he kept playing and playing I really felt sorry for him particularly since I didn’t know the game then it’s only later on that I learned but at the time I knew nothing yes literally nothing but I don’t have to go into all the details now 1

 away                            But there  was that   tremendous poker   game
 that went on for three days straight and three nights I was really tempted but I didn’t want to lose my fifty bucks            Finally I walked away.
     He could do the same Have the same thing happen to his fifty bucks. No he’s too busy with Mary on the boat But sometimes it happens A guy comes to America An immigrant He’s got a few bucks to get started a new life he gets caught up in a poker game or a crap game on the boat and by the time he lands in New York usually it’s all gone:
                                       Most of these guys have to work as dishwashers or janitors when they arrive or else it’s straight to the factory for them eight hours or more a day hands bleeding dreaming of the old country
 I knew a guy like that once                     It’s  always the same  story.
      Beginner’s luck... Bullshit!
      Luckis something that goes with the weather. If it rains you’re fucked. That much I know. Like that time I was walking down the street and ^ it was raining and I was sure it was a lucky day for me just because I woke up that morning feeling happy the sun was shining when it happened but by the time I was walking down the street it was raining like hell and I slipped and fell and almost broke my leg. I didn’t break it but I could have.
                         And people talk to you about luck!
         Talk to that guy the little redheaded punk about luck yes do it with his flush and I pulled a full house on him 3 kings & two tens
                                                             He simply said see you around but you could tell who he was speaking to
                                                                                                                                      to
                                                             be honest he was looking at me straight into my eyes I didn’t look back I
simply looked above his head past his red hair.                  .........I
simply wanted to get the hell out of there.......                       QUICK
                                                                                                                              takes guts
to do that that fast                I played two or three rounds Faking it
                                                             really Literally giving away a few bucks to get the first card and then fol

                                     only one more hand I kept saying to    g
                                     myself and dammit if I didn’t win another pot with only a lousy pair of jacks something like 25 or 30 bucks more but even that counts      :
pays for a few boxes of noodles.
                                     The other guys had really cooled off after the big hand and I felt like they admired me—who wouldn’t—but it’s not certain maybe they were just being nice to me to get their money back tough shit! that money baby that’s for the room and the noodles the coffee and the toothpaste and all the rest of the stuff I didn’t say that of course I didn’t even think that at the time I didn’t think anything at the time I was too chicken I don’t even know when or even how I got out of there I didn’t even know in fact the nextday I don’tevenknownow how the whole thing started. Must have ^                                    been in L.A.
It came to me only when I was on the bus. The next day. Greyhound bus. On my way to New York. Yesterday I arrived in New York that’s how
 I’ll start on the boat. But then I was down to about 1200 dollars or less. It must have been when I thought up the whole idea of Double Or Nothing
                           Double Or Nothing
That’s it! I said to myself... But by now I must have about a thousand left / maybe less or a little more but just enough to where I will have to figure / out everything down to the last penny down to the last detail and / tomorrow we start Lucky Irememberedthetypewriterforamoment /
I thought I had lost the pawn ticket I had pawned the typewriter / in Las V egas it was inmy raincoat pocket I had a raincoat in those \ days I would really be fucked now without a typewriter couldn’t\ afford to buy anew one evenif I cut down on the noodles the coffee the\ tomato sauce I couldn’t make it those damn machines cost a fortune even\ when used and with a used one you never know what will give\
I don’t have to go into the typewriter now except when the screw
                                                   fell off            yes
         Must have been conditionally about the 127th day:
         127 boxes later a screw fell off the typewriter It has to be Something like that always happens to those damn machines and then you fuck around for days tiying to fit the little screw into the proper hole Particularly when you don’t have the proper tool to woik with at the time it happens — 127th day
Write it by hand that’s what the little voice of reason tells
                                                             you
                                                             in
                                                             the
                                                             back
► of
                                                             your
                                                             mind
But that’s impossible
Can’t even reread my own handwriting And then after a while
you get cramps in your fingers and you can’t go on particularly at the speed I plan to write the damn thing minimum 12 pages a d
                                                              a
                                                              y
         By the 127th day when the little screw fell off, I must have had about 127 times 12, if you count only final pages, approximately 1524 pages impossible nobody can work that fast even if you waste two or three boxes trying to screw the little screw in the proper little screwing hole in the typewriter...
         No use anticipating of course Maybe the little screw won’t fall off around the 127th day Maybe it’ll happen later or even earlier One never knows But undoubtedly a little screw will fall off It always— you can bet on it—happens And you screw around for days trying to fix the damn thing so that the machine can go on..........................to the end
In any case Til describe the whole thing step by step And of course that’s without counting all the pages I’ll throw away all the garbage

                  days that’s a lot of days
                  Let’s try something for now: Jack!
                  If I had a chance to change my name
                     That's what Fd choose for myself: Jack!
I love that name.     Except that in his case it should be Jacques and not
                                                         Jack!
In French it’s Jacques
                 —  can’t get around it since he comes from France —
                 —  that’s got to be made clear from the beginning — —on the boat when Mary asks him what’s his name—
                 —  ray real name is Jacques he says, just like that —
What a liar!
I suppose nihavehim do muchthesamethingl did. Travel: Los Angeles or Las Vegas and all the other stinking places Fve been to and eventually he ends up in New York it’s quite obvious that we may converge or merge. And little by little we’ll coincide. We’ll overlap. He&I.                                                                   TO
                                                                                                                                  GE
                                                                                                                                  TH
                                                                                                                                  ER
Fll even make a gambler out of him. Teach him the game. Not immediately! He’s too inexperienced in the beginning but eventually. And besides you’ve got to be able to speak the language or else they take you for everything you’ve got Even if it’s only fifty bucks. During the coffee breaks 79 cents ajar—on sale in the factory Chrysler—a damn good car 111 have him get involved in a few games. A few quick crap games. But he loses all the time at first:
                 Hurts to lose all the time Hurts like hell near the heart
                                                             near the guts too But he has to learn. Doesn’t help to feel sorry for him or for myself. It’s a waste of time and
                                                    of course a waste of money too
and when it comes to money he'll learn quick.
At that rate you’ll never get the damn show on the road:
                 416 dollars just for the room then the noodles on top of that ?
Got to start all over:
                 365 boxes one pound each at 29 365 times 29 makes $105.85 correct Could start adding up just to see where I stand:
                 416 plus 105.85:          416
                                           105.85
                                             521.85
Here goes half of my earnings — almost — if you can call It that
I've got to work out a system Immediately to keep track and to keep above the surface. Best way of course Is to make a list and keep adding up as yougoalong. Nodoubtaboutthat Withallstyounevergetlostevenwhen you’re lying even when you’re telling a story. True or not true. True or false. Allstmakes It look credible. You have to make lists In life lfyou want to survive. All sorts of lists or else how can you go on?
                         or else you forget 1/2 or 2/3 or 1/5 of what you want to say and that leaves l/2or l/3or4/5ofwhatyouwanttosay that Is said. That’s not too too bad considering that most ofwhatyouwant to say Is crap anyway.                                      Lies
or                                                     Leftovers
Here are examples then of possible lists
        Examples of lists:
        1. List ofj obs Jacques has during his first year in America.
        2. List of people he meets during that period — 365 days
        3. List of girls —girlshe screws and girls he doesn’t screw.
        4. List of things he wants to do during that time but never does.
        5. List of possible names for Jacques if I decide eventually that I don’t like that name.
        6. List of things clothes-souvenirs-junk-etc. Jacques has in his suitcase when he first arrives in America.
That’s the way to gol Then you take each list and you develop—you expand:
 Number One that’s no problem because you can always Invent a little Yes jobs are easy to invent Travelling salesman Grocery store clerk Parking lot attendant Dishwasher Factory worker Waiter Shoeshine boy Pimp and of course Unemployed or partially employed depending how much money you need.
 Number Two that won’t make much of a list because most people after they’ve asked you how long you’ve been in this country and how you like it simply forget about you even if they have politely invited you for dinner or if they casually say in a conversation why don’t you drop in sometime...
 NumberThree also won’t make much of a list particularly the first part unless ofcouiseyou are irresistible Bu twhen it comes to the second part that could go on and on particularly if you count real and unreal girls The types you dream about or even those you follow in the streets without ever having the guts to speak to them The unscrewable ones The virgins The snobs The rich broads The ugly bitches.
 Number Four is the kind of list that can go on and on to infinity It’s Just a matter of time and patience The places you want to visit the money you want to save the books you want to read the movies you want to see the girls you want to marry the things you want to say or not say Etc...Etc...Etc,..Etc...
 Number Five is the kind of list that depends a great great deal on the mood of the guy writing the story In this case me Here you can use real names if you wish or made up names even if they are not believable or foreign names or else skip names altogether and simply furnish blanks perhaps...
 Number Six won't make much of a list either except if to be stuffy %ou decide to list everything down to the last piece of junk like an old used up bus ticket or a rubber band or a worn out pair of socks or a postcard that somebody sent from a sunny place or even the guy*s all-tom-y eUowed-andscotchedtogether-birth-certificate or else his pipe if the guy happens to be a pipe smoker at the time...
One can make all sorts of lists like that.
But most important is never to lose track.
                       For instance right now the most important is the list of things I need in the room once I have the room
    list of things for the year from now to the end / 365 days before switching to The Time of Noodles.
                                                    Or else the whole system is all screwed up. Everything falls apart and you have to give up.
But you can’t give up     Right! then
    I won’t X swear
                                   Fine. But then it doesn’t have to be logical. Doesn’t even pay to work in alphabetical order Would be useless in fact Just straight down the line:                   n  t c t t s
                                                oooooo
                                                0 m   f o o a

Soap next. Yes soap. Just like that. A guy’s gotto wash Water Gas Electricity all that included of course. For eight bucks a week a guy would have to be crazy not to include Gas Electricity & Water or else he would have to give up washing
                                                                                                                         that’s for sure.
          No problems then so far No need even to save —
          Also it’ll pass the time A shower now and then when you're depressed and here we go risingfrom the water like-Lagarua fresh like a brand new baby boy — smelling like a flower.
Soap! One bar a week?                        That’s too much?
                                            That’s not enough?
          52 bars for the year!
                                            That’s almost right!
                                            That’s too much!
20 for the year
and that’s it.... no argument.
          Of course one can always make mistakes. But how can I figure out everything without goofing? Every penny counts and besides how the hell do I get all the stuff into the room without attracting suspicion once I have decided what I need in the room? That’s an enormous question - a giant dilemma - some wise guy would say.
Time is essential of course. Even if you buy a few items at the time they’ll think you're mad. They’ll think you’re hoarding away like the end of the world is coming or like you know something they don’t know. Things like that happen all the time — nowadays.
Like during the war... the occupation... and what an occupation!!! I just can't walk into a grocery store and ask for 365 boxes of noodles... they'll think I'm cracked... they'll look at me as if I'm crazy... even in the supermarket you just can't walk around with a buggy full of noodles... noodle boxes... 365 of them... it's not normal... it's irregular... they'll think you're a salesman or something... only thing to do is make trips... lots of trips... up and down the stairs. ..Up& Down...
       Let's say you buy 10 boxes at a time... 10 boxes in one basket... that's almost human... nobody can question 10 boxes... and if someone asks you can always say you're having aparty...afamily dinner 10 boxes in one basket that's a little more than 36 trips... 36 trips just for noodles!!! 36 and 1 /2... trips... to be exact... but of course since you can't have half trips... all trips are full trips... it'll have to be 37 trips... yes. ..up & down the damn stairs...
                                                                                                                       Sweating like
hell... arms full of boxes... unless you decide to buy only 8 boxes at a time... 8 boxes each trip... that makes more trips... of course... 42.625 trips exactly... that's idiotic... 10 boxes a trip is much easier and much faster too... you come out with an even 1/2 trip rather than that goofed-up little .625 trip which in itself is an impossibility since you can't cut boxes in half... all trips are full trips... unless of course you make 35 trips with 10 boxes and the last one... the 36th... with 15 boxes... then you have only 36 trips... but the best is 37 trips... 36 with 10 boxes and 1 with 5 boxes... makes more sense... yes... 37 trips:
                                                                                                         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29

   the stairs \ up & down

I could cut down the Up & Downs if I took 12 boxes or even 15 instead of 10 each trip But one trip more or less                            who gives a shit
                    Doesn’t pay just not to go through that Up & Down shit again
And besides there is all the other junk too:            52 cans of tomato sauce
   10 cans a trip. That’s 5 point 2 trips on top of the original 37 of cours
                                                                                 e
I’ll make the point 2 trip a full (rip with  the 5 tubes of toothpaste
                                              the 26 jars of coffee the new toothbrush the salt and the pepper
A guy’s got to be practical.
                               Who ever thought I would get so involved with trips                                         Up
                               And yet                                        &
                               I’ve been around                            Down
                               A world traveler indeed
But if there is an elevator in the place then it won’t be so hard on the legs I like the sixth floor gives you a feeling of being way up at the top or near Even if the stairs stink like hell — So many stairs in one’s life yes And
                               So many closets too.........................!
I didn’t think of that. If there is a closet in the room then I can save some space. Have more horses in sight. But can you trust closets? Even though most rooms have closets. Particularly in my case and his case too closets have a very special symbolic meaning:
Remember-------------------------? “My life began in a closet
                                     Among empty skins and dusty hats While sucking pieces of stolen sugar”
                                     ParmiLesMonstres, Paris, 1966-67
Sugar dammit! almost forgot! make a note quick                            Sugar
Nobody would believe it:           “Outside  the Moon tiptoed across the roof
                                     Frightened I ran down the staircase but Slipped on the twelfth step and fell..
                                            Ibid.
So many stairs in one’s life!
And so many closets .... too!
Doesn’t matter. 365 boxes of noodles wouldn’t fit in a closet that’s for sure Doesn’t matter how large the closet is. I’ll simply line up the walls from the floor to the ceiling:
                           I can already see the place
                             and myself in that cubicle of boxes
                             and the horses flying on the wall paper
                             wall to wall noodles
But I’ve got to be able to see my horses/                   /That’s essential/
Pile the boxes in the center of the room/                   /What a good idea/
A square tower of noodle boxes: 12 by 12/                   /That’ll be great/
And walk around for exercise twice a day/                   /That’s essential/
Of course you’ll have to climb on the chair to take down the daily box
                                                                             can’t
                                                                             start
                                                                                at
                                                                              the

or else the whole thing would come crashing down on top of me — bang I can already see myself perched on my chair selecting the daily box : macaronishellselbowszittispearsmanicottispaghettitwistedcurlyroundetc readingthelabels—thecookinginstructions—theingredients—thediscourseetc
             —would be funny as hell if one night the whole— —Tower—

 Of course they’ll find the manuscript unfinished. They’ll read it perhaps. Judge it for sure. Edit it maybe. Publish it eventually. And sell it probably. Criticize it certainly. Make a movie with it quite possibly. A lousy adaptation with a bad actor and a phony ending. Or else they’ll destroy it. Yea. Burn it publicly. Step on it publicly.

  Posthumous Masterpiece Found In Noodles
 No those boxes are not heavy enough you’re kidding yourself you could work your way out 365 bars of soap would be more dangerous but I said 20
       20 is enough    How much for each bar? They should make little-
 free booklets with all the prices for guys like us. So many prices to check and no booklets. Just that alone can discourage a guy: drive him or you ^pad/nuts/crazy/ding/fou/sonne — drive him or you straight to his///your grave/hole/box/trou—drive you or him out of your///his head/mind/tete/cul
 Therefore: Got to decide —10 cents —15 cents a bar — 3 for a quarter —
                               3 for a quarter:
                       that’s not unusual that means you can either get 6 times 3 makes 18 or 7 times 3 makes 21
            either way doesn’t come out even.
            Let’s go for 21 gives you an extra bar
                               3 for a quarter makes 7 quarters
            21 divided by 3 and multiplied by 25 cents makes
                                                             $1.75
                               Add $1.75 to the previous total and you’ve got a brand new total.
                        But where the hell is my previous total?
                                      Definitely without a list

Some of that crap I should be able to buy on sale don’t think of stealing at this stage — too early. Next item?
                            Shit! Almost forgot:

                                     crapper. Can’t do without.
            Could go back to newspaper like in the olden days he should be used to it but not me I’m spoiled by civilization and culture but after a while you get a sore ass from the
roughness it’s so rough And anyway newspapers cost money too and worst of all you’re always tempted to read the damn thing to read the dates the advertisements the news the comic strips even if they are outdated or all fuzzy or even if the thing is discolored No
No newspaper. That’s for sure.
Nothing to do with the outside world-----------------------
                                        ----eveiything inside-------
        Make a list quick
        of things to do without No papers
                                 No books No telephone No clocks No watches No rubbers No time
                                 No social involvement No human contacts No deodorant No cars that's obvious
                                 No bicycles
                                 No mass communication
That’s a list for you and I could go on and on like that for hours. NoNothing just the TEmeq/TfoodJesboxafterbaxdown to nothing.
When there’ll be no more boxes then my time will be up

After he lands in New York he'll have to be on his ownYes Uncle Arthur No David will be waiting for him on the pier You're sure about that No Uncles Sam James David Yes David is better That's what I said before A little old man who can hardly speak English That's the irony He doesn't know that his uncle is also a foreigner Firs t generation Yes I am the only one who knows that Uncle David is not an American and thathe speaks five languages yes but not English or at least not very well in fact very badly Yes That makes it more interesting Here we have a guy who speaks five languages but who can hardly speak English Five languages no kidding German Russian Polish Hungarian and Yiddish that's if you count the last one as a regular language and whose English is so lousy he can't even communicate with his nephew when his nephew arrives in America Yes That's irony for you Bu t who is to know that he never met his uncle before Nobody told him Nobody Talk to me about mass communication after that A little old man who speaks five languages but mostly Yiddish and his nephew Jacques doesn't speak a damn word of Yiddish of courseFrench Jews don't speak it any more Adead tongue for them At least not the new generation the left over generation
                 the reduced generation Those who didn't end up as lampshades I don't have to go into that but it's there in the background and will always be there Can't avoid it even if you want to The Camps

boat is slowly approaching the dock. A band is playing and thousands of people maybe more are waving their hands and handkerchiefs. It's a tremendous scene. It's dizzying. Noisy. Confusing. Imagine that. He's standing next to Mary on what seems to be the upper deck in his double-breasted suit. His only suit except for the green sweater in his suitcase. He's holding on to her hand squeezing it tight. He can't see his uncle in the crowd. And anyway doesn't matterhe doesn't even know how he looks his uncle. Unde David definitely. More real.
 How the hell will they meet? What will they say to each other? Will they kiss?
 Will they cry?
 These are questions that will have to be answered eventually.
 Damn good questions and there are many more to be asked soon.
 The first question is simple:
 Evoitually Mary points to a little old man in a brown suit and an enormous red tie with rimless glasses on hisnose and no overcoat It'ssummertime therefore
 hedidn't wear his overcoat Nohateither. That'syourunde! Shecried. I know
 it'shim! Whatisshe? Some kind ofvisionaxy? a prophet or something? How
 didsheknow? Nobodyknows? Instinct? Bluff? Luck? Whatever fhecase she hititrightonthenose. That'sfbrsure. Inolmean Robert? imagined him quite
 different Tall in a darkish suit with a striped tie and perhaps an umbrellait's
 cloudy that day a big felt hat with blue shinyshoes. Unde George! The things
 a guy invents when he doesn't know. Uncle George! Why not Theodore? And Robert I What's going on? What a nice pair they would make together. Uncle
 George with his nephew Robert from France. Charming! But Unde David and
 Jacques that's not the same. Though Robert that's not a bad name except that
 after a while everybody calls him Bob and he passes for a real American except of course whenhe open his mouth to speak then everybody knows for sure
 what he is. Nogood. He'sgottostayaforeignerforawhileorelsethewhole
 story falls apart. The fiistyear at least. Then why not something more French
 more European more cosmopolitan, Marcel... Andri... Jean-Louis... too Catholic. Ernie? No! Abitmore Jewish even though this isnot—Iinsist—a
 ^Jewishstory. Thiswholethingtoldfromthepointofviewofal9year old a bit
 naive. Why not try it out for a while while he's standing on (he upper deck of
 the boat with Mary in his double-breasted suit holding on to her hand anxiously wai ting toget off theboattomeetUncle David on thepier and get started with his first year in America.
          I was standing next to the girl from Milwaukee Mary was her name I believe. On the upper deck in my double-breasted suit. A grey suit. We met the first day at sea on the lower deck while the band was playing. We quickly became good friends. It’snotunusuaion boats. But she refused to sleep with me.
          He's so shy he won't even say screw with me
        Not that she didn’t want to. But somehow you see itnever worked that way. We necked quite a bit on the deck. The upper deck in my double-breasted suit. Sort of greyish with the American tie Uncle David sentme from America in one of the packages. And the American socks too. During the nights. It was beautiful. Sometimes themoonwasoutoverthesea. And the sea was socalm. So...Sodreamy. Itwasmyfirsttriponaboat. Butitwasfoggy in New York when we arrived. You know the kind of fog that drips from everything and makes you say what alousy weather. Scary kind of fog. The kind that makes you feel lonely.
          What a romantic
          Lucky Mary was there. But it never got very far. I mean the necking on the upper deck with the blanket. Couldn’t get into her cabin because of the other girl from Chicago. Fat and ugly. I slept in the big hole down below in the precipice where they shove20 or 30 or evenmore guys together and it stinks like hell. Feet and all that other smell. She must have been older than me.
Sort of blond. Cute. With funny teeth.
          His aesthetic notions are underdeveloped
          I loved her. I can’t tell if she did even though she told me she did at that time. She was so nice to me. So understanding. So comprehensive. So compassionate. We promised to write to each other regularly. And she said that she would try to come and see me in Detroit.
          I suppose he already knows he’s going to live inDetroitaletteror something the address on the packages a guy does not have to be a genius to put two and two together and guess that if(he packages comejromDetroit then thatrriustbe where the guy who addresses the packages must be living in this case uncle David of course
           Milkaukee is not very far from Detroit that’s whatshe said if you know how to get there. Across the lakes. The Great Lakes. That’s what she told me. She even showed me on a map. I was standing behind her. Very close. I was looking over her shoulder while she was pointing with her finger on a map of America I could feel her behind inside her blue shorts. She was wearing her blue shorts then and I was wearing my green sweater. What a lovely behind.
           Doesri t even have the guts to say ass
           And funny thing is she did write to me regularly during the first six or seven months at least. I still have her letters.
           r 11 throw in a few letters six or seven as samples of what she
           writes him that's good for two or three boxes of noodles
           But she never came to see me in Detroit. That’s a long story. Am I allowed to go into that? It might take a while. But first I should describe the encounter with my uncle. On the pier. He was wearing a brown suit and a red tie. I had never met him before. Mary is the one who pointed him out to me just like that What a nice girl.
 Unbelievable the things a guy can invent
 It’s so easy
 Easier as you go on
 The first six months or so
 It’s the last six months that are tough
 The last stretch
 When you’re fed up with the noodles When you can’t take it anymore When the little screw keeps falling off the typewriter When you’re down in the hole At the bottom of the precipice crawling like a rat In the beginning anything goes But later on it slows down You spend hours and hours just wasting time %Vith the curtains closed you won’t know if it’s night or day Just keep going that’s what I keep telling myself With my beard down to my belly
These are questions that will have to be answered eventually.

                                       —  Uncle David doesn’t have a car—
I could have told him that But he goes on and on...
                                    Oneday I gotaletterfromMary.
                                    Must have been six or seven months after I was in Detroit My English had really improved a great deal too so that I could really read her letters. I read them and reread them often.
—  Still in the first person—
                                    It was a funny letter Saying that she was engaged to be married and that I would understand and that everything was fine and that he was a great person the other guy an old school friend from Milwaukee who was serious.
She was a college girl from a good family Lutheran. She must have been to be able
to spend a whole summer travelling in Europe by herself. It’s expensive!
To write a letter like that takes guts at least two boxes. When I got it the letterlthoughtit was theendofthe world. Eventhoughwehadnotseeneach other again since the boat I wanted to die tremendous! but that’s not an easy thing to do in America After six or seven months in America things do change fast for a guy like me.
                            Dying becomes almost meaningless — I mean you’re so lonely—so cornered—so speechless—in the darkhole of your furnished room boxes all over and Chrysler and school in the morningif you work the afternoon shift or in the eveningif it’s the other way around you don’t even think of dying anymore — it’s hopeless — useless — yes:                                                       !
                                                                    It’s sad
That’s about it                                               For now.
He can jump around like that in his story    Feeling sorry for himself
Since he remembers the whole thing and remembering is always a confusing process.                                   When you remember
          you don’t remember                        in a straight line never.
      Things don’thave to be in C-H-R-O-N-O-L-O-ai-CA-I^O-R-D-E-R In fact most of it is plain lies—lies.               Barvardage.
In fact if you go on like that they’ll take you for a Bavard you know Le Bavard

In any case I paraphrase verbatum my translation:
          Besides the sequence of events does not matter and believe me if I analyze if I buildhypotheses ifl temporize it is less by scruples that I might let something get lost of what comes to my mind in bulk than to allow myself to play a little game as frivolous as it is inoffensive at which I do not claim to be a master a little game which consists primarily ofholding your interlocutor at bay and then through sham resulting from a rather deplorable habit to lose him with what could have been what has perhaps what has surely not been and what would have been and whgt has been overlooked—by the overalllooker—to say and what was said which was not said and so on until finally losing patience he cries out: GET TO THE POINT
                                                                                                     GET TO THE POINT I
One could set up indeed a whole series of scenes to work with series are always useful just as much as lists are always useful.
                                               First the scene on the boat.
                Quick make a list immediately of possible series of scenes:
1. Scene on the boat the excitement of arriving in America. Not
                    too much description. Feelings. Lots of feelings. The people. The buildings. The streets. The taxis. The dogs in the street. But in the beginning it doesn’t really feel like a foreign country at all. America! feels like any other country at first.
2. Scene in the subway the excitement. A bit more description.
                    With feelings too and emotions. The girl. The legs. The ass. Uncle David almost asleep. The people. The blacks. The suitcase. In the beginning it feels quite different. The subway! feels somewhat like it’s not the same at first.
Nothing does.      That doesn’t mean much. It means that beingin America
                        doesn’t feel like being in a foreign country
                                                            feels like being in the same place as before same as in your own country
if you have one.
Unless of course you come from a place like Japan or India or Arabia
                                  or some place like that
       then of course it feels different
            many things are different :
First there is the language
                             that’s different
         Since Robert doesn’t speak a word of English he does feel like a foreigner when he tries to speak But when he does not open his mouth then he can almost pass for an American with his American tie socks and green sweater.
 In the beginning he is not as surprised by what he sees as he had expected to be. That’s always the case. That’s a good point in fact.                                                        Nobody is.
 Things are a bit the same all over.
     The first impression is important however
     The first scene the arrival of the boat in New York:
     The excitement the landing the waving the people the buildings...
     One could go on like that for hours remembering impressions
                                                             colors
                                                             feelings
                                                             sensations
 People rushing around with suitcases           shouting
                                               pushing
                                               shoving
                                               ciying
                                               cheating
 He knew many of them now after nine days on the boat              It was a
 slow                                                   boat
 Many disappeared in the crowd and he never saw them again even though many of them said they would keep in touch—the number of people who say that to you in your lifetime and never do it’s unbelievable. Many wrote for awhile—but eventuallytheystopped writing. ^          Maiy wrote for a while until she wrote that she could notwrite
 anymore. She was engaged. She wrote first. That will be better. And he answered immediately. InEnglish. HisfirstletterinEnglish. He had sent letters in English before to his uncle but he had a friend who studied English write them for him. But this time he tries his
English alone. Withalittledictionaiy. Lookingup every word tobesure. In alphabetical order.
                               Must have been about a week or ten days later.
         A good ten days after they arrived in Detroit. More than that even. Agood twelve days. Soundsbetter. Even more than that since he spends almost a week in New York with his uncle, sight-seeing. Let’ssay then thatby the timehegotherflrstletter and answersithe answered it tie same day he gotit—unless it was already there when they arrived in Detroit then it throws off the whole thing but that’s looking for more complication than necessary.
                  Let’s say thatby the time he got herflrstletterhe knows quite a bit of English. Quite a few words. That’s simple enough to assume. I don’t have to make a list of all the words he knows by the time he gotMaiy’s first letter but I could list all the things he saw in New York. That’s a nice touristic touch:
Lbt of Things He Saw in New York:                 The Empire State Building
                                              The Statue of liberty The B. M. T,
                                              The Bronx
                                              The Museum ofModem Art
                                              Macy's
                                              Fifth Avenue
                                              Central Park
                                              Times Square
                                              The Jewish Daily Forward
                                              Rockerfeller Center
He describes all that to Maiy in his first letter five pages at least.
Even the cafeteria where Uncle David took him for his first meal in ^America.
         Writing of course is easier than speaking. At least it’s not the same. You can say anything you want. And besides you can always find words in the dictionary.
                               He has a little dictionary
                               French-English
                               English-French
                               pocket size he bought it just before leaving knowing that it would be useful in America In fact the first few weeks he always carries it in his pocket that's crucial and logical
                               Gives him a feeling of security.
  Then the first meeting withUnde David that's the second scene Uncle David was a little oldmandose to sixty badly shavenyou couldn't see that from the upper deck but when he kissed him Robert felt how badly shaven he was—it scratched Should I have him cry now or wait until he's alone?
  He was a nice man even though not a real unde he had married a cousin of his father — that makes him sort of an unde — unless it was a step sister or a half sister of his father When *lt comes to human relationships Robert is very unsure of himself but it's not a major problem though it could become a major problem eventually. In any event I know for sure that they don't have the same last name the same family name.
 Do
 I
 have
 to
 furnish last names?
 All
 last names?
                            That complicates the situation.
 Unless
         I
         use
             real
                  names!
                            Nobody goes around giving his last name unless he's asked to when speaking                            in
                                                                    the
                                                                   first
                                                                person
                            That's another good argument in favor of the first person.
                            As for the second person the noodler if s out of the question.
                            And the third person the protagonist it's too early.
                            And at this point it's useless even to mention the fourth person.
      let us therefore ignore this matter at
                                                         this time

I tried to see some family resemblance in the uncle’s face.
I couldn’t tell at first.
Then after a while I was sure there was none.
A strange sadness in his eyes behind the rimless glasses.
Resignation perhaps? It’s more suitable. Insecurity!
And lots of silence.
He hardly speaks.
                                                                People rushing pushing
          shoving all over.
Suitcases everywhere.
The silence between them is extremely important.
I’ll go into that further.
Even in the subway later on.
That’s the next scene:                  Uncle David wanted to carry my
                                        suitcase but I didn’t let him.
                                        I insisted on carrying it my self.
He doesn’t have to insist with words.
He simply insists with gestures.
I’ll have to stress the silence between them and the gestures too.
The meeting of two strangers.
Here is a man who speaks five languages and a young man who only speaks one: French.                     And since Uncle David does not speak French he only
                           SYKaksRmsianPolishHungarianGermanYiddish...
andRobert doesnot speak any of theother languages it’s adamn difficultsituation. They can’t speak to each other.
I have to do sometiiing about Robert I don’t really like Robert
It’s neither French nor American It’s both It’s nothing. Change it:
 Solomon! a lot of French Jews were called that but they changed their names during the war. I don’t think there is a Solomon left inFrance today.
A guy would have to be crazy or masochistic to keep a name like that.

The War The Camps The Train
The Farm           Nothing of all that as though he had not even been marked
                                                               Consciously,
                                                             Or at least he doesn’t know it obviously.
               I do of course necessarily.
               That should come in flashes.                          Images.
               This way you have a kind of existential situation.          A
               being       who springs up on the boat
               Reborn.
               Available for any eventuality                For action
                                                              for the future.
               Freedom being his most essential trait                    no!
               Freedom is something else. He doesn’tknow what to do with
                                                                          it.
               Also subconsciously he wants to forget
               Always dreaming of the future. Lots of dreams. At night
                                                  during the day
                                                                                                    daydreaming his life away All the things he wants All the things he wants to do
Ir-
On the boat he builds up a whole story about Uncle David. Its easy since he doesn’tknow a thing abouthim. He tells Mary how rich his uncle is and howgenerousheis. Whatahugebeautifulhousehehas. Whatanenormous car he has. Two even. And then when they arrive Uncle David is waiting
                     at the pier with the car. They drive away. This is realty the first time he rides in the front seat of a car. He drove in trucks before and maybe in a taxi once or twice but never in the front seat of a car as though the car was his.
             Theydrivetoarnagnificenthouseinthesuburbs, They talk a lot. That’s another thing. Robert doesn’t know a thing about houses. Only apartments. Crummy little apartments. Or better yet. Furnished rooms. Crummy filthy little furnished rooms.
             Uncle David’s wife did not come to the boat he thinks Uncle David is married. But in fact he has no wife therefore no aunt for Robert.
                                                                          But later on you’re realty disappointed when the things you Invent don’t come true. That’s the problem with situations like these.
                            I'll have to rewrite that part several times.
                            Once I find the right tone it will be easier.
                            But so far I have the room worked out. The noodles. The tomato
                Did I finish the coffee?
                The toothpaste and toothbrush that’s settled.
                ♦-Anyway I am working on the toilet paper I didn’t think of that! And the sugar for the coffee no cream and the salt for the noodles. Or else the stuff Is undrinkable uneatable.
                                                                              Sounds ridiculous to an American but it's true
                        The things a guy thinks he knows where in fact he doesn’tknow.
                        It's so simple to invent.

for the day. And in case of emergency you can always swipe afew salt shakers from a restaurant: 2
                                   or
                                3            Just to make sure. I’m not
                                            going to go around spending money on salt
Could do the same for sugar. But there it’s more tricky. Won't work. I could cut down to two spoons a cup. No! Always three. Three. It’s stupid but two spoons onfy and I just can’t drink the stuff. It's wasted.             Salt definitely ni swipe three or four shakers.
I won’t even bother
         calculating        salt But sugar definitely that's another matter.
Can’t waste too much T...........I......M........E on that however.,

 He tells Mary about his uncle Everything he has invented abou thim as though itweretrueShedoesn'tbelievehimofcoursebuthedoesn'tknowthatAndshe doesn'ttellhimthatshedoesn'tbelievehimShesimplymakesbelieveshedoes.

           “You know some people have a job during the day and go to school at night—that bitch — it’s not unusual.”
           “I know alotof kids that do that work their way through college taking courses at night—that stupid Mary she really wants to ruin everything for him in advance. Yes takes a while longer to finish but it’s the same in the end.”
  He doesn’t agree with that.
  First you learn English he tells her.
  First you learn the language and then you get a job.
  I don’t really know what I want to do but first I go to school.

From the moment he walks off the boat there goes his illusions
           Uncle David is a short wrinkled old man who wears a wrinkled brown suit with ahuge red and blue tie you couldn’t see the blue in the tie from the upper deck only the red and who doesn’t even own acar They walk next to each other without talking In fact they hardly talk to each other after they kissed on both cheeks on the pier Once in a while they try to ask each other questions in English but it’s useless They can’t find the words So they simply walk together in the streets in total silence

                                           They walk toward the subway side by side they didn’t even take a cab Imagine That on his first day in America
                                           There is a fever in the air You always get that feeling when you arrive in New York Every time For Solomon all this is new Not For Me.
         I felt it again this time when the Greyhound bus pulled in.
 I’ll have to describe that feeling:
                The noise The smell

Lots of yellow and green cabs.
                                           The noise.

Never fails
            You always need to take an aspirin
Never fails
And the suitcase is gettingheavy Uncle David doesn’t walk very fast but still the suitcase is getting heavier and heavier Uncle David is a slow walker still he has to stop often to change hands Solomon’s suitcase is all black but still he has to stop often to change hands it’s black with a brown leather strap yes a brown leather strap around it that’s typical all foreigners have straps yes around their suitcases it’s like they didn’t trust suitcases and if they don’t have straps they use rope never fails very often they use rope instead of straps
They’ll call him Saul for sure with a name like that

                          Maybe it should be a rope around it?
                          No                 That’s too obvious!
                          You don’t want to push things too FAR

The sui tease is very important must avoid cliches              In fact
    suitcases are as important               as rooms in this story

Life by suitcase                             Almost what ImeanYes
But this time in his case the black suitcase with the brownstrap around it represents somethingmore than just a suitcase     Everythinghe owns
is in it                                          Everything

And it’s getting heavier and heavier as they walk toward the subway
They didn’t even take a cab---------------that's the next scene
                                                      the subway—
They are on their way to the Bronx to visit one of Uncle David’s cousins

Mostly black.
Of course Solomon doesn't know that they are going to the Bronx.
He has no idea where the Bronx is or what the Bronx is.
His uncle didn't say that they were going to the Bronx.
He simply mumbled something in English orwas i t Yiddish?like Brawnx.
Could have been "We are going to the Bronx".
                                          Doesn't make much difference He didn't understand anyway. His uncle said they were going someplace.
                                                                                                              That much was under stood
                                          but where Tha t much was mis-under-stood So they are just going someplace and ithappens that they are going to the Bronx. You have to. Youjustcan'tstandthereonthepier onceyouarrive

The new phase: that's what you call it. When I arrived in Vegas must have been three in the morning. The guy who gave me a ride from Bakersfield or was it San Bernardino? said Good luck man
                                  I had slept a little in the car while he was driving 90 miles anhour            at least through

Looking for the nine
 it came
Looking for the five
  that came too
Looking for the four
  came easily 3-1
I threw a few chips $5 on the six 6 and the big eight 8 Then looking for the five again.
 Unbelievable:
          I kept shooting with my left hand for luck you might say just because I started with the left hand.
1
I shoved another pile of chips green and som e yellow in my pocket 25 dollar chips and some five dollars in my pocket my left pocket pants pocket must have been close to 200 bucks.
This time I was going all the way a big pile on the line green and yellow chips I didn’t even count I just pushed the stuff on the line didn’t even make neat little piles. Just pushed it but the guy made neat litde piles for me just to make sure.
I wish I could have sat down my feet were killing me and too many cigarettes. My throat was sore. I grabbed another one another free cigarette and bang Bang eleven Eleven and another big pile in my pocket my coat pocket this time and I still had plenty in front of me.
Couldn’t go on like that forever that’s for sure Double or Nothing go ahead Double or Nothing the little voice in the backofmyheadkeptsaying tomeorsomewhere around there I mean the back of my head.
I didn’t have the guts I left only 10 bucks on the line and motherfucking stupid ass it passed & it passed 7 and it repassed7 let it ride let it ride it’s a good sign go on double up double it up Double or Nothing.
I said it aloud while shoving everything I had in front of me on the line except for the green and yellow chips that I had sneaked in my pocket except for one green one on the seven always cover the seven man.
I blew on the dice and rolled still throwing with my left hand seven it is!
The mob around the table was jumping up & down up & down & sideways too and screaming and puffing and feeling good forme and encouraging me to go on. There must have been at least ahundred or ahundred-fifty of them standing around the table supporting me and quite a few good looking girls but I was too busy to notice the girls I just raked in the $$$
ROLLBABYROIL here comes that bastard again—sideways That’sit! Iknewit.
          It’s like the story ofPalucci and his gang
                                            you know Palucci Sticky Zutalors Mirabelle Elephant Bug
What a story:
                 It all started in my head the day the Six of them decided to steal the Eiffel Tower tosellittotheTurks. Then with themoney they went down toMonte Carlo tobreak the bankplayingroulette.
                                      The Six of them sur rounded the table and before you knew it they each had 20,000 apiece francs of course.
                          20,000 times 6 that’s a lot of dough even if it’s only francs.
                                    But they lost it all the next day or a few days later in Las Vegas playing the slot ma chines. That’s the way it goes.
                                              I knew them well I mean the whole Gang even if it sounds unbelievable. 20,000 apiece. And they blew it.
                                          It’s quite normal in that kind of a
                 story.
But what a coincidence talk to me about coincidence:
                 Just as I woke up in the lobby in my big chair my suitcase an d my typewriter squeezed between my legs sitting on the money in my back pocket a guy came over to me—quite a friendly guy — and what a coincidence it was none other than Palucci himself.
                                                                    He started talking to me. Told meallabouthisnewlife. Nomoregamblinghesaid.
                 He’s finished with that. He’s in politics now.
                 Explained to me that the way to save America was for him and his gang to take over the government. It’s as simple asthathesaidto me. I didn’t argue with him. I was too tired and my feet were killing me. Bad.
                 That’s quite a streakyou hadyesterday he said tome. I saw him com ing. Ei t h er h e wan ted to borrow m on ey for his c ampaign
               or else he was sincere. I didn’t really answer. I smiled. Yes. Idid mumble a little something like not bad but I could have made more if I had gone all the way... I mean Double or Nothing... towards the end. Oh well he said that’s the way the cookie crumbles. He laughed at me. That’s exactly what he said whatever that means.
                                    And then he disappeared. It was like a
               dream. Abad dream.
                                                                                         Could
               have been a dream.
                        I dream all the time in situations like these. I wonder where the rest of the gang was?
               Sticky / Zutalors / Mirabelle / Elephant/Bug          ?
I didn’t have time to think about them and anyway it doesn’t fit into the story it merely confuses matters because it was impossible for him to tell me what he told me when I woke up in my chair in the lobby of the Desert Inn with the suitcase and the typewriter squeezed between my legs it was impossible because I had not had my streak yet I mean the big streak except for that lucky 150 bucks you remember in my back pocket the night before the ham and eggs in the coffee chop so the whole story is a joke Palucci is a liar that’s for sure or else he does not exist that kind of coincidence never happens even if you’re lucky like hell you just can’t mix reality and fantasy like that just for fun you just can’t it doesn’t work or else the whole system is all screwed up all fucked up etc. etc. etc. etc.........................................
        I knew it
        I knew it the moment that guy came back with his
                                       ROLLBABYROLL
                                           rollmyassbaby.
I left only about ten or twenty bucks on the line and started throwing silver dollars all over the table: on the seven
                                    on the crap-eleven on the no-pass-line
what’s a few bucks!                even if you’re contradicting
                                    yourself.
And I threw the dice................. four
                                    four is the number that’s what the guy said Everybody could see that.
I looked for it the four three or four times.           Got a few $'s back
                                                        Lost a few too...
But I knew I had shot my load. Bang! SEVEN! The guy shouted like
                                                                                     he was happy
I could have told him I could have told it to all the guys around the table
There comes a time when you know you've got it when you can't push
your I u c k
That's when a guy with some sense gives up the whole thing and quits and
walks away and certainly I deserve a medal for that: I xvalked away from the
                                                      table without even look ing back without even leaving a tip for the guy who shouted all my good numbers and all the bad ones too too bad
I had left my suitcase and the typewriter hidden behind that big chair
the same one mentioned before.
I asked if they had a room.
I was dead.
The guy behind the desk was friendly even though I hadn't shaved in
three days.
The guy behind the desk said it would be $18.00 for a single.
18 bucks for a room! Wow! What a story I could write in a room like that.
                             Imagine!
18 bucks though you couldn't do it on noodles—that's for sure.
                             Impossible!
18 times 52 that's 936
                   936 bucks just for a room alone                       Wow!

I started walking out of the place when I felt the weight of the chips in my pockets Silver dollars $1 Green chips $25 Yellow chips $5 in my pants pockets and also in my coat pocket the sport coat I was loaded like a mule In fact it was so heavy I couldn't walk straight I was staggering all over the place I must ha ve looked funny from the back like a guy who is bowlegged or better yet like a guy who's got the shits merde que je me suis dit.
I found a little comer in the lobby all by myself and started counting my chips.

I took my bundle all tens and walked all the way downtown Fremont Avenue carrying my suitcase in one hand and the typewriter in the other—switching hands from time to time because of the weight the suitcase being heavier than the typewriter it was a little 0//vrtf< portable which I had bought used the day I started thinking about the noodles or was it before?—I found a room for six bucks in a crummy ho tel next to the bus depot I was exhausted I pushed the bed against the door just in case put the money inside a sock and shoved the sock inside my jockeys right against my dick this way it was safe because nobody would think of looking for the money there unless the guy is a queer or a fanatic

           Important also is to remember that the whole idea of the room and the noodles and all the res t came to me j us t as I woke up after I had the dream about the money-water and the huge hard-on rubbing against my money-sock in my jockeys that’s a very good touch.

 Las Vegas                         It won’t be the same for him
 you’re getting everything confused
                                       . his story and my story..........
 it’s not the same.......and entirely different moods

 In the subway It all started there
 He had never seen so many black people all that in the first person in his life.
 He was thinking to himself the things one thinks about in one’s lifetime:
          Did I forget anything?
          About the landing Uncle David
          Mary                     she disappeared in the crowd eventually

 All that will have to be rewritten several times it’s obvious but once you find the right tone it’s in the bag it’ll go easy particularly once you have everything ready           in the bag      in the room           in your head .
So far           let us recapitulate:   The room
                                       The noodles The toothpaste The toothbrush
                                       Did I finish the coffee? Can’tremember Can't remember everything
              The toilet paper
              I didn’t think of that
               And the salt the sugar And the coffee
                                               the sugar for the coffee Or else the stuff is
                                                           uneatable
                                                           undrinkable
I’ll get ten pounds for 52 weeks. That’s a pound for 5 weeks point 2. You get that stuff in 5 pound bags. So you get three five pound bags and it’s in the bag. No. That’s only 15 pounds. I mean that’s 15 pounds only. Too much. It doesn’t work. Though 15 pounds is better than 10. 3 five pound bags at 63 cents a bag that’s $1.89 exactly. No savings. Unless you keep a special fund for emergencies. For movies for instance. Movies are important. When you can’t take it anymore you’ll sneak out and go to a movie. Even in the middle of the night. Idiot. Nobody will see me. And who cares. I’ll rush down to 42nd Street. They play all night. Maybe two. Or three movies in one night. But that’s cheating. Let’s try without movies. Unless by the 237th day I can’t stand the damn seclusion anymore. Then I’ll decide. In the middle of the night. But that does present a problem about the emergency fund. Of course if I don’t have an emergency fund I won’t be tempted. If I don’t have an emergency fund I’ll do without. That’s obvious. That’s more than logical. Indeed it’s self-evident
---------------- ------------------------------------------------------
Can one take it though? 365 days without movies that's a long time! It’s worse than without ^ screwing w /~. --^And the toilet paper? Never thought it would get sodvfficult
                            socomplex              OK....       theList:
thaf 8 the problem:
Definitely without a list it won’t work definitely
 1. Noodles............................... 365 one pound boxes
 2. Room..................................8 bucks a week—52 weeks
 3. Coffee................................one jar for two weeks
 4. Toothpaste............................80 squeezes in a tube
 5. Toothbrush............................ one new one at 59 cents
 6. Salt..................................no problem—free
 7. Sugar.................................3 five pound bags
 8. Soap..................................20 bars—no deodorant
 9. Toilet Paper..........................definitely—a must
 Tremendous'. It's easier than I thought as long as I keep going like that.
 How much do I need toilet paper? Newspaper would be too tempting
                                    like movies.
 Nothing to distractyou. Complete concentration. I begin to understand what they mean by concentration concentration camps.
 Some guy came up with the idea of L'age Concentrationmire. AFrench guy
 of course. Doesn't work in English- there are so many things that don't work in English.
 Indeed!          Can't translate everythinghe says verbatim.
                  Therefore I'll paraphrase as best I can.
 Indeed!          But don't lose track. Stay with it. No digressions.
                  The main points as much as possible.
 -  Toilet Paper: Two craps a day?
                  Normally one in the morning. Usually quite regular I understand now what they mean by regularities about that. Whenit comes toregularityl'mquitearegularguy though one never knows under the conditions in which
                 I will be working the conditions to which I will be sub jectedinmyroom. Perhaps I should keep track, have a chart or a daily record. For the future. Forposterity. Or for sociologists. It is indeed an unusual situation in which I shall find myself.
                                                                              A
                                                                      Shit-chart
                 Normally they tell you on the wrapper how many sheets in a roll:
                                      500?
                                      1000?
                                                          double-ply of course.
Always standard size they haven't yet invented the king size in toilet paper though they do have colors—patterns and evenperfumed
2 rolls for 27 cents      usually
                        also no family size in shit-paper that would be too much they might someday You never know with those bastards imagine a whole family working on a family size roll.
What's certain you always use more than one sheet at a time Six or seven Even more
And each crap requires several handsfull handfuls?
Also you use the stuff to blow your nose Also you use the stuff to wipe the mirror after a shower Also you use the stuff to clean your glasses if you wear glasses it's a waste.
I could measure        how many wipes in a roll?
I can see myself already trying out how many wipes in a roll One could get a sore ass from something like that definitely.
Also you have to allow for constipation
                        not in my case Headaches once in a while.
In the end though I guess shits and constipation balance out
                        definitely I should have a little supply of aspirin
What a difference it might have made for Robinson Crusoe if he had had some                   a minor point of course but not to be neglected.
                        Make a note. Aspirin. Two boxes
    no suppositories though—that’s a great word it supposes that you might or might not be able disgusting little bullets up your ass. I’ve never tried but I can imagine a guy shoving those little things up
Let's keep it clean orderly
How many times can you wipe your ass with a roll of toilet paper?
Whoever thought that a guy might get hung up on a question like that?
    They say 500 sheets but who ever really checked to make sure?
    You always grab a handful
                                      HcmdlnHand
    They stood on the upper deck it’s too simple — and besides I don’t like the name Marry—with one “r" or with two “r’’s—it’s too nothing. Got to be something more catchy. More like her. More American. Typically. Coulditbe Peggy? That’sagoodone. He had never heard a name like that before. How do you spell it? He asked. P E double G Y. That’s easy to remember. With Peggy. Alittle blond well stacked. With clear blue eyes. And a nice round ass. They met at the beginning of the trip. The first day as the boat S.S. Marine Jumper left Le Havre. She was standing on the upper deck next to him her hair in (lie wind. Something like that.
    “Lovely, isn’t it?”                 A Handful
    He didn’t understand what she meant at first.
    “OhI You don't speak English?”
    He understood that. Peggy moved ablt closer to him. Andtherehe goes feeling like crying suddenly as I watched switching to the first person the coast of France recede with the horizon he wouldn’t say “recede.” He wouldn’t even think of the word. In fact in French
he would think something like:      Je me sentais triste en
regardant lacdtesebarreravecVhorizon. J'avais presque envie dechialer. Etc’est alors que la gonzesse, une petite blonde du tonnerre ewec des yeux bleus et une poitrine formidabe, est venue pres de moi et a commence a. baratiner en anglais. J'ai rienpige a ce qu’elle disait mais elle etaitgentille comme tout et moi alors j'ai plus eu envie de me sentir triste et de chialer pendant que je regardais la cote de France disparaitre d Vhorizon. Disappear. Fade away that’s about it. Somebody was next to me. Somebody had spoken to him. After all these were Important years yes very Important years he was leaving behind the Train the Camp theFarmwe are not going to discuss. Yes nothing of the past. A clear break. Symbolically that Is. As soon as the coast disappears he turns away from it toward the waterThe ocean. Toward America
    “Vousetesfrangais?” Lovely the way she said that. “Moijesuls amerlcaine." And she goes on and on with lovely little grammatical errors. Take guts to speak like that. “Voulez-vous marcher devantle bateau pour voir cet immense ocean mleux?" Shows you. It really made him feel warm Inside that someone like that next to him would talk to him. Did she sense something? Y a pas a dire she was really cute. You never know with girls from Milwaukee. Yapasadire they are surprising. Loneliness? Sadness? The feeling of breaking away from something important or at least from something whichyou j ust cannot forget? It's possible. I'll never know. Nor will Solomon ever know since he never asked her.
    “VousallezenAmerique?” What a question. Where else could he be going on a boat like that?
                          She’s got to become more important. Even if I have to invent a little. She reappears towards the end of the story. It's easy to start a story but to end It that'sanothermatter. Of course I won’t have to face that problem until about the 300th day or let's say 300-350 days from tomorrow because tomorrow we begin. - October 1st - and that’s itl

You could also combine endings:
She flies in to see him to explain
to justify herself and they decide to kill themselves together ►-
But the sexual act being an ironic substitute for suicide therefore having managed to convince his girlfriend—Peggy—that she has to commit the act of
   felo-de-se with him Together they proceed to a deserted spot at the top of a mountain He carries with him a bottle of poison a revolver and a rope But in spite of the implied seriousness of the situation the whole affair quickly turns badly and becomes a grotesque comedy For when they reach the chosen place Peggy who has removed her skirt in order to how shall I say1 storm that summit with more ease seduces him and he — the protagonist! — can no longer carry out what he had planned so carefully So together—it's obvious—theyfindjustification for their failure in a passionate act of sexual indulgence—love & death being the same thing in the end That is if of course you decide to use this particular type of ending for this particular type of story in which love & death are combined at the end into a more effective tragicomic

   convinces him to calm down She drops the other guy —
   the one she knew in college O — and together they try to

   n
   But she is such a fine girl he does not have the courage to kill her and eventually they both drift apart—which
   —  I could have told them that — is not unusual in situations such as these whereas the whole affair starts on the wrong foot — indeed I could have told them that immediately evenbefore they started messing around on the upper deck that unless he screws her it cannot possibly work out for them — and it would have been so easy for them All they had to do was ask the girl from Chicago to take a walk on the upper deck and the whole affair would have been quite different right from the start and officially the letter would have been more meaningful and I personally would not have the problem of trying to combine end i n g s !
^"She was indeed a fine girl. The type he had never met before. And beautiful besides. That’s one of the reasons among many he got so involved with her. And of course it helps a great deal that she speaks French, this way they can ask each other all sorts of questions about each other, about their respective countries, about the past, and their
potential future, and what they are thinking and feeling, and what they plan to do even if they never quite do it : there are all sorts ofpassibUities:
        She was walking next to him on the upper deck the wind blowinginherhairherhairflyinglooselyinthewindhishair is all messed up but he doesn’t care asking each other all sorts of questions: “Your first trip to America?” That’s a good one as if a guy like him was in the habit of going to America regularly—and when it comes to regularities ask Solomon— he’s the most regular the most typical type of guy—
But        Was he the kind of guy who travels to America every summer?
        What does she take him for?                 Abusinessman?

It's so easy once you get going:
                                                                                        Everything which—up to this point—was protecting and inspiring the storyteller on the threshold ofhis (ale— the destiny of rational ity and of teleology/ the long continuous process of thought beyond time, the awaken ing and theprogressof consciousness andits perpetual recapturing of itself, the unfin ished movement yet uninterrupted of totalization, the return to an origin always open, and finally the historico-transcenden tal thematic — all this might disappear re vealing for analysis a blank different space without any inferiority nor any promise whatsoever and this is only the beginning
                                                        Of course one can avoid such pitfalls but still it will be necessary to go into more physical details later on. Give dear and precise descriptions of his physical appearance befbregettingin tahispsychologjcal make-up. Indeed define each trait of his character quite dearly and specifically without exaggeration
                                                        That's the only way to give a truly-credible-human personality to that type of character. Forinstimce:

And here we go. But of course that doesn’t solve the problem of the toilet paper. And also the money. People will want to know where it comes from.
                                            Poker or Craps?
 Doesn’t have to be either one though either one works      unless
                                                          unless I decide
 to borrow the money / it’s all the same / but borrowing means you’ve got
                                                          unless

 take                                                              fof
                                                             off

 Have you ever considered the possibility of borrowing the money? Just enoughfor the room the noodles and all the rest365days. Which means you’ve got to have an exact figure down to the last penny. Of course it doesn’t work unless you borrow with the intention of never returning the money. Whoever loans it to you doesn’t have to know what you plan to do with it Good twist! It means getting out of the country for good and never returning. You would have to get out permanently. Assuming then that this is how you get the money it kills the poker game if it was the poker game and the crap game if it was the crap game. It’s a difficult question to resolve particularly if you decide to have him do the same eventually. But assuming I borrow the money. And I don’t mean borrowing from a private party. That’s out of the question. Nobody would trust me. I mean borrowing from one of those loan places. Even I would not trust my selfwith borrowed money. Nobody in his right mind would want to invest in a deal like this one. Even your best friend if you have a best friend would be suspicious would think you’re cra2y would tell you to give up or go to hell. This is why it’s essential to find one of those loan places that loans you money without any securities credentials or collateral.
 "All right then.
 Lucky there are such places. Businesses that love to loan money to guys like you. Takes a long time to find out about these places when you are new in America.              Sometimes more than five years.
And of course you need some sort of security. Credentials. Collateral. But that’s easy to invent.
                                        Solomon doesn’t know about all that in the beginning. Takes a good five years even more before you leam all the ropes. Neither did I in the beginning. That’s why the first five years are so tough.
For him.
For me. For anybody in our situation.
But borrowing is not a bad idea. Butyouhavetohaveanexactfigure. You Just can’t walk in and say I want to borrow some money. They’ll ask how much? If you don’t know they immediately get suspicious and look at you de trovers.
You’ve got to know down to the last penny.
You've got to justify the amount Can’t say approximately one hundred, orahundred and fifty bucks fornoodles that’s just a figure as an example at this point. Or simply 1200 dollars. No. You have to be more specific than that.    They may even ask you for a
breakdown, Just to bug you.
You just can’t say one hundred or one hundred and fifty bucks or so for noodles.
Noodles -!- the guy would say Are you some kind of nut? or else
                                Are you on some kind of special diet? You’ve got to invent something more credible more reliable. Even potatoes would not work. And then when you get the guy convinced but you start mentioning the toilet paper for sure the guy will throw you out ofhis place.
                             That damn toiletpaper keeps recurring. Can’t get it out of my system. Can’t get it straight either.
        A roll a week give or take a bigger wipe here and there------
        52 rolls then.
        You can’t take a chance and run out. Thatwouldreallybea hell of a note.
                                                                                        That would certainty'
        force a guy out for the room.
        No shit about                          that!
        If one runs out of toothpaste one can do without. Sugar also even if the coffee tastes like piss. Noodles that you can always stretch out a bit even though it’s at the core of the whole
 system. Essentialinfact. That’s survival. But toilet paper? Dammit! How essential is it? One will never know. Unless Unless one goes through the whole business of finding out. Counting the number of wipes in one roll                                         :

Beginning of a new season.
Beginning of the school year for most kids. September is always wasted for most kids. In fact for me summer vacation always ends -
 October 1st
 October 1st
But I’ve got to stick it out each day day after day
each day of postponement means more money spent more time wasted waiting for the starting day for the beginning for the launching for the arrival
for the arrival of the boat It means having less of ever

                                          s a week then 52x2 that’s easy 104 rolls
                                  they always come two by two —
                                  means you divide 104 by 2 and you’re back where you started that’s easy
                                                                   52
                                  52 times 27 makes 14.04
         Here we go again with that little              .04
Can’t get rid of it and it’s purely accidental I can assure you nothing calculated in that .04 There are numbers like that that keep popping up and one really never knows if it’s chance luck the stars god heaven fate destiny or coincidence or simply a joke
                                                            with me it seems to be .04 but with other guys it’s number 3 or number
5 or even better yet number 7 and of course you have guys who believe in number 13 some of them believe 13 is good luck and others bad luck and others as soon as they come across number 13 they immediately chicken out and then of course there are those who when they see number 3 immediately think of the Trinity and if they see rats or black cats then they really get scared-
                                                                                      But for me 04 means nothing but coincidence
or simply a joke
                                                               For me .04 simply means .04 Nothing symbolic about this number
                                                                                                  unless of course I symbolize it :
 I can have the 0 stand for nothing — Death and have the 4 stand for something — Life
                                                                                                            then I have: 0 is Death
                                                            4  is Life
 But that’s like looking for noon at two o'clock or approximately.
 If one runs out one can always swipe afew pieces handfuls from public places.
 In case of emergency.
 Even though that may mean getting out of the room all-of-a-sudden. And I shouldn’t by all means:
                                                                                               avoid absolutely getting out of the room
 if not it doesn’t count.

 'Of course
 I won't have that kind of responsibility.
 If I don't want to go back that's my business        n'est-ce pas?
 But it will take strength
 it will take will power to make that kind of a sortie or avoid making
                                     that kind ot a sortie

 And most important never get tempted by                    a cup of coffee
                                                             a piece of ass a hot dog a movie
 Yes!
 No definitely no exit                      Avoid getting out of the room for 365 days
                                                                                                                                              Is it possible rj plausible ;
 That's the chance one takes            Of course one can always use one's

                                         Dip it in water and wash one's hand afterwards
 This brings up another problem*.
           How long can I hang on for one stretch? Two months? Three months? I mean without going outside without even opening the window in order to look outside down at the street up at the sky. Even that in a way should not be permitted unless it is approved as an exception once every 37th box a quick look out of the window. But will it be during the day or during the night? Impossible to decide now, particularly if I work with the curtains closed. I might be asleep during the day and again it mightbe thereverse I might be asleep during the night. Wait & see. And if you can't see anything then it will be better to forget about the whole thing. The visual is important but should not take precedence over other crucial problems.
 Mouies                 that's another matter
 Movies                                 are important for inspiration
 k                                                     for  relaxation
 You go straight to them and come right back and no stopping anywhere
                                                      no speaking to anyone no looking at window shops.
   Could be done ifyou’re strict enough with yourself but It’s a matter of self-control It will take a great deal of will power a great deal of concentration.
   indeed
   Tricky to know exactly how much to save for movies in case I do decide to save for movies...
   Perhaps if I start the list now it might help:
            Room..............................416.00
            Noodles........................... 105.85
            Coffee............................ 20.04
            Salt..............................     0.00
            Sugar.............................     1.89
            Toothbrush...............................59
            ToUetpaper........................    14.04
   Son-of-a-bitch! I’ll never get ready.        That funny little 04 Is like
   an o-b-s-e-s-s-i-o-n-1
   The time one wastes getting ready putting things away calculating procrastinating It’s unbelievable It’s truly discouraging it’s all these point 85 point 89 not to mention that point 04 that goof you up never comes out even and even ifit did so what?
   I   should have thought of all that before in fact I should have the first sentence already In my head maybe even the first paragraph on a piece of paper so that I don’tforget it the opening sentence Is always a real problem a guy can-easily-get-stuck with a first sentence and spend a whole year 365 days just working on it and not getting V- anywhere the opening sentence or for that matter the whole opening page is crucial if not it’s all dead a dud.
   Some guysread the first page and they immediately giveup they don’t even try to go onyou've got to hit them hard with the first sentence the first paragraph toe first page particularly then they don’t give up they
 go on to the end of the page page after page turning the pages with trembling fingers expecting the worstheld in suspense and bangyou hit them on the head.
 What does it is the right tone the right rhythm everything has to be there in the beginning in essence and in substance.
 The essential difference here whatever that means is not the material as such nor the manner In which you present it nor the message nor the language itself but to doit
 What counts is to do it. CompactandClear orbetteryet Sfrnpleand Direct
 Take for instance this kind of opening paragraph:
         Mr. H****** turned the comer and saw, in the failing light at some little distance, his seat. It seemed to be occupied. This seat, the property very likely of the municipality, or of the public, was of course not his, but he thought of it as his. This was Mr.
                   attitude towards things that pleased him.
         He knew they were not his, but he thought of them as his. He knew they were nothis because they pleased him...
 Superb!
         The character. The setting. The tone. The mood.
         Really makes you feel like you want to go on
 Or take this second example:
         Yesterday my wife left me. She took her toothbrush and left without aword. Just like that. True, we rarefy talked to each other, but still, on such an occasion, she could have said something, anything: Seeyouoround, So long, Goodbye! Hell, at least leave anote. Ithurtsjusttothinkofit. What am I, a stranger?
 ^Fabulous!
         What a beginning! Suspense. Pathos.
         What language too:                                  quick
                                                                                                                         precise
                                                                                                                        succinct
       Really makes you feel like you want to go on and on
Indeed.
                                                                                             You’ve got to stay away from the typical
       “La marquise est sortie a cinq heures.”
Could start with       Call me Solomon !
in the first person     but Solomon ?
                                                                                  Callmelshmael ! that’s a name. Biblical
                                                                                                                      Solomon too.
But .............. Call me Solomon ! it’s too funny.
                                                                                                                            They'll call him Saul for short for sure.
Though for this kind of discourse anything would do:
                      Call me Stanley!
                      Call me Charlie!
                      Call me William!
                      Call me Richard!
                      Call me Raymond!
                      Call me Dick!
That’s what they start callingyou after a while in America. They always do.
They always do it to you.
       Always cut it short.   Like they were ashamed or something
       Always do it:          William.............Bill
                              Richard-------------Dick
                              Raymond-------------Ray
                              Robert..............Bob
What a friendly world!
       But                    Stanley.............Stan
       No.                    That'stoocrappy.    Honest.
Call me more names: Call me Marcel - Call me Jules - Call me Louis -Call me Jim.
'i
 Could make a whole list and let whoever wants to decide decide which name he likes best—or better yet let him choose a name at random from the given list of names—given anywhere and anytime at the pleasure of whoeverisfurnishingthe list—thus allowing whoever decides he wants a name for the person whose story is currently being told and he is in the process of reading—assuming of course that he has the courage and the patience to go on to the end or at least far enough into the story to need to
 choose a name............
                Why not Boris ?
                                                                     2
                                                                   Boris
                                                                      !
                                                                      !
 That’s a good name. Doesn’t have to be Russian even though originally his father came from Russia. Lots of guys are called Boris and they do not come from anywhere in particular. They like the name Boris or rather their parents did and they call themselves their parents rather call them Boris and everybody wonders where the guys with names like Boris came from originally. I knew a guy who was in fact called Boris once and I liked him very much. But I never wondered where he came from or where he went. That’s none of my business. In fact with a name like Boris Solomon could have a much stronger personality. And besides there’s no way you can cut Boris that I know. No possibility of nicknaming him. You just can’t say to anyone whose name is Boris: HiBo! Sounds ridiculous —HiBo!
                              Boris that’s it for now. No last name though. Particularly since he might speak all the time in the first person. Then he doesn’t have to mention his last name his family name. People speakinginthefirstpersonusuallydon’t. That’s one problem less. Unless of course they introduce themselves formally to somebody else. Then evidently you can’t avoid last names. But even then you can always furnish a false last name. Happens all the time. In hotels when you want to sneak out without paying. To the police when you’re arrested. And so on. Howeveritdoesn’t pay because eventually thefind outyourreal name and either you have to give your real name or pay the bill or else they stick tpouinjail. Immediately. That sort of thing happens all the time.
                  But still the number of false names in the world!
 It’s unbelievable.
One could possibly furnish a list of possible
Last names:                      Ticklebrown
                                 Abramowitz
                                      Mararvt
                                        Putas
                                 Salopinasse
                                      Barrett
                                 Magarshack
                           Hombredelapluma
                                       Murez
                                    Hubscher
          Adozen or so real and false names
                    Long ones and short ones But that can take you a long way Could put the list at the end or in footnotes It’s been done before Never works of course It seems modem enough butfinally it’s gimmicky Particularly in footnotes At the end would be better It may even work As long as you don’t exaggerate A dozen names at the most Don’t even have to spell them out
                                             Long ones and short ones That makes a decent list
 Let whoever wants to choose a name at random a long one a short one a medium one or even a veiyveiyshort one like Puce or even shorter like Pou                choose
 a name at random                           In other words what you need
                                          is a list of possible names:
 Jirst&last
            and then select or rather let whoever wants to select select the name he or she that’s always possible prefers anytime anywhere tosuit the purpose ofhisor her perusing through the discourse now in progress
            But better yet
            leaving out all names: first & last
                                             in order that he or she may be able                                                             may
 %&ve the complete freedom of choosing willingly or randomly a name or several names depending of course on the situation and the number of people involved In the situation for the person whose adventuresare currently being told and fabricated and presented and related for the pleasure or rather for the information of the person
 male ox. femalewho is presently or potentially reading or going to read the discourse
                                  However
                                  the guy whomever he might be who
is composing or rather fabricating the discourse couldmay very well help by simply giving for instance the first letter of each name: first & last— with blanks for the rest of the name and let the peruser male or female fill in the blanks with whatever letters he chooses in whatever order he chooses in whatever language he chooses or she—just like that:
 Exactly this way like the above t in alphabetical order. All names with the same number of blanks 16 and with a period . at the end:
 One letter the first
 Sixteen blanks------------------------------------evenly spaced
 One period . at the end of each name
                                      But of course indicating preferably in a footnote that whoever wants to may add or subtract any number of blanks to make longer or shorter names according to his or her heart’s desire.
                                      This may undoubtedly be of some help to some people and may seem very confusing to other people but you cannot—that’s obvious—please everybody.
                                      One could of course go further and furnish the first letter and the last letter of each name and make things easier for some people and more complex for others.
                                      Or one could even go much further and furnish not only the first letter and the last letter of each name but throw in one more letter somewhere in the middle and let the people who have the courage the determination the patience and the imagination fill in the rest of the blanks.
                                      There are all sorts of such possibilities here but evidendy the best and the simplest way would be to give all the names first & last right away. Write them down in straight prose from left to right
                          without any breaks...............
                          without any                    Up
                                                         &
 ^                                                     Down
                          without any breathing oooooooo pauses
                                                              and especially without any............... in the middle .
                                Then you have what can be called:
a very simple style
a very direct form of narration without any distractions
                            without any obstructions justplain normal regular readable realistic leftoright unequivocal conventional unimaginative wellpunctuated understandable uninteresting safetodigest paragraphed compulsive anecdotal salutory textual boring plain

For instance:
    We got off the subway at 185th Street just like that. I remember that quite clearly in the first person. Quite vividly with a lot of adverbs. It was a very warm, humid, and sticky day and lots of adjectives and commas. Or was it 210th street and a great deal of confusion and indecision? By then the suitcase was getting quite heavy
and lots of realism too. Particularly as we myself:
Boris, and my uncle: David went up the stairs into the streets.
    Paragraphs too. We had hardly spoken to each other lots of silence between them shown with white spaces or blank spaces or better yet with two or three blank pages in the middle of the scene to indicate the silences since the moment we kissed each other on the pier. Uncle David was walking very slowly with his back slightly hunched. It struck me how everything about him was brownish that’s the kind of remark one can interpret two ways or even three. His shoes, his socks, his suit.
His tie too interesting point: from the upper deck it looked red, but at close range it was really brown, or at least more brownish than red — the tie. The suit was baggy. The shoes worn out and badly polished that's another good point to remember, how badly his shoes were polished. His skin also was somewhat brownish but not because he was suntanned, far from that. It must have been it’s natural coloring. Lots of descriptions takes more room.
   New paragraph. It’s clear now that Boris is talking in the first person in a very conventional manner. Then up the stairs to the people’s apartment in the Bronx. No need to describe the place. It was the usual type of place. It was a nice apartment. Shiny clean furniture. You could tell the wife was a good housekeeper unless she had a maid? The man was about Uncle David’s age. Maybe a bit younger. Better dressed though. He had no suitcoat on but still you could tell. A white shirt with a blue, striped tie. I forget the color of the stripes. The woman was fat, round, with very curly hair that should do. Not bad looking for a woman of her age. Should have a name for them. A lot depends on whether or not they are related to Uncle David. If they are related they may have the same name though that’s not necessarily so. If they are not related then it doesn’t make any difference. They might be distant relatives and not have the same name. I really do not know. But one thing is sure they are not related to Solomon. That I can assure you. I mean Boris. That’s for sure. Boris doesn’t know that. I do of course. Or at least I will
when the time eomes. But I don’t have to tell him everything. Cousins! Distant cousins of Uncle David. Makes it more authentic. In America everybody is a distant cousin of somebody else.
   Jacobson I think their name was. Also there was another woman there when we arrived a neighbor or something. She had come because she was curious to see me she knew they were coming. She was also a fat woman but much younger than the other one I don’t have to talk about her but it is interesting to know that she was present. As he explained to me she came to see the new arrival from Europe. A French Jew, that’s unusual. Normally French Jews do not immigrate. They don’t even admit that they are Jewish. How can you be French and Jewish at the same time? It’s not rational. And the French are extremely rational.
They have been like that since the 17th century at least. Good observation. At least that’s what they claim, even though they won’t admit for quite a while now that they are tragically unprepared for the 20th Century.

                         I suppose they expected him to go into all that in details or else why should that womanbe there?
                         Certainly she must have had a reason for coming—that woman! Orf'- '       1                      Thatfs the first real thought in Boris’ mind since he arrived in
                                     America... when you first arrive in America usually your mind is quite blank at first... Takes a while before you can begin to think straight in the beginning... It’s a matter of speech
                         How can you explain?           The German Jews
                                                         The Polish     Jews
                                                         The French Jews What a race
                         How can you explain? the difference to them ?
                                  The man. Mr. J acobson that’s a good false name for this kind of a story and his wife a fat woman with a flowery dress. It’s August. Mustbe. Ormaybe early September. Summer anyway. Hot like hell. And the other lady standing there. Mrs. Somethingorother Madame Machinchouette. Very hot. Sticky. Important. Particularly since Boris is still wearing his very heavy suit. Double-breasted thafs the style in France. His only suit of course except for the green sweater in his suitcase. But it’s not as warm in the Jacobsons’ apartment as
                                  it was in the subway. That’s for sure......................
                                                    The Subway Scene! what a scene! comes before the Jacobsons-------------obviously.

 I’ll have to work on that
           It's a damn good way to bring out his character
 After all he is only 19 About 19 He did have a few pieces before but never spent a whole night with a woman a whole night just screwing He's really inexperienced when you think of it but that does not prevent him from dreaming all the time about it In fact that’s one of those ■ things he dreams about all the time even while they are sitting in the Jacobsons’ living room he thinks about it the other woman is still there
Must have been a good two hours now since they arrived there maybe more eventually the Jacobsons ask them to stay for dinner and what a coincidence
                                     What did the Jacobsons serve for dinner?                   yes
                                                                                                             ffl © ® <& 2 <8 ss
                                                             But before that before they ask them to stay for dinner must have been a good two hours later
Boris finally asked where the bathroom was.                        Not
Nol
That’s not It.
They asked him if he needed to go just like that.
                                                  Not immediately But eventually
First they gave him a glass of milk hates milk and then they asked him                                          eventually if he
needed to go                                          and then
                                             immediately showed
him the door down the hall on the 1

                                             of course It could have been different
                For as a great egocentric once said:
                                Never believe anything a writer tells you about himself
                                                         a man or for that matter a woman comes to believe in the end the lies he or she tells himself about himself or she tells herself about herself

                          He does it in front of the mirror above the sink in the bathroom with the girl’s legs and stockings and the little brown triangle in front ofhis eyes the whole thing like a colored picture the images some guys have in their heads in situations like these!
But that’s no reason.    It’s just because. One never knows why.
                          Damn right.
First Day in America
Seems like just any other day at first except for the tall buildings / the noise / the cabs / yellow and green / the people / black and white / the subway / and of course the strange language / first you think it’s going to be the same / you think / or rather you assume / the people are the same / except when they speak / English /but in fact it’s quite different / the whole world / seems to be f

For him it's even more important: not only a new place
                                            a new life a new country but also Peggy Uncle David
                                               locks himself in and feels like
                                                                                   like
the subway ride the silence the suitcase the girl with thelegsspread apart and all the people mostly black and the people in the Bronx and that other woman that bitch who came to see just because she was curious all that down the hall first door on the left he running away crying also
                                       There is a little mirror above the sink in the bathroom. There is always a little mirror above the sink even in my room. Helps. He stretches up on his toes to see himself better. His mouth slightly twisted into a grin or a grimace same thing. And then comes the huge feeling of guilt. Always happens afterwards. That goes back to your childhood to your mother and all that crap. People usually call it guilt but it could be called something less dramatic. Guilt or no Guilt it’s necessary—particularly in his case.
 First day in America.
 And What a Day!
 First day in the room I suppose Fll feel the same way after all the excitement of getting things ready: noodles
                                       coffee
                                       sugar
                                       toothpaste
                                       toothbrush
                                       toiletpaper and all the rest ♦feat I have not yet discussed but will have to discuss eventually and of course the horses on the wall counting them up & down & sideways October 1st and the table by the window with the typewriter on it and everything ready for the first sentence in my head all set to go
and the curtains closed and all the decisions made whether or not I work at night or during the day and Boris
                                        Jacques
                                        Solomon or perhaps even
                                                     his story: the Boat the Pier
the Subway Ride the People in theh able to wait to tell us the whole story:
                                          Marcel
                                          Robert
                                          Jim all ready to go with
 the People in theBrotixaW excited about itimpatient hardly 11 us the whole story: the War
                                         the Farm the Camps and I in the midst of all that stuif real and unreal ready to go 12 pages a day one box a day of that enriched noodle stuff 365 days to go down the white precipice and the little screw ready to fall off on the 127th day or something like that and all the other things that will eventually happen or not happen in the room when alone in the darkness of the mind one awaits the flashes of light that come with imagination and a knock on the door any door can disrupt the whole system then you wonder why such a day is important why a guy needs to jerk off why the mirror above the sink is important and so the first day it’ll be inevitable down the corridor first door on the left I too will lock myself me and myself
                                me you I he all of us together. Alone.

                no guilt no sticky feeling deep inside even though that’s exacdy how he must feel when he comes out of the bathroom down the hall his legs and crotch very much clammy sticky his eyes bloodshot
 That other woman is still there when he comes out of the bathroom

They ask him some questions Questions about the War the Jews how it was during the War how he managed to escape In English in Yiddish Doesn’t matter Uncle David answers all the questions for him Almost as though he was the only one responsible He should be proud and responsible because he is the one who brought him over here.
        Later on when Boris tells the story he changes things a bit:
I didn’t say much :::: during the whole time we were sitting in the living room:::: of the Jacobsons:::: We must have been there agood three hours:::::::: I needed to go to the bathroom but I was afraid to ask:::::::: I didn’t even know how to ask in English:::: I showed them with my hand :::: But they were ignoring me completely :::: They kept speaking to each:::: other:::: Uncle David the Jacobsons and also another woman:::::::: I thinkshewasaneighborwhocame to see what was going on :::: Just curious I suppose :::: They kept talking to each other but I could understand :::: almost :::: everything they were saying surprising :::: They kept saying how much they had suffered :::: During the war:::: I mean the Jews:::: over there :::: how much they had suffered :::: but that included them too:::::::: Jews like to suffer well for most Jews even though they were in America the whole time:::: during the war:::: I wanted to point this ou t to them while they were drinking tea:::::::: from tall
glasses with pieces of lemon floating on the surface of:::: the tea:::: and sucking pieces of sugar not stolen:::: and eating:::: cookies and remembering all the Jewish people they knew or the people:::: other people knew :::: who had been deported :::: and exterminated :::: during the war while they were in America:::: suffering for them:::: Except Uncle David:::: I mean suffering the suffering that they thought all these other people who had been deported had suffered over there and grabbing another cookie and pouring a bit more tea into the tall glasses :::: but no more lemon :::: using the same old piece :::: all brownish now :::: floating in the tea :::: Eventually somebody :::: the other woman :::: I think :::: asked Uncle David if I needed to go to the bathroom:::: and he said yes:::: I think he should need by now to go to the bathroom:'.'.: It was down the hall :::: First door on the left :::: :::: When I came out of the bathroom I stayed in there a long time:::: just to be alone:::::::: they hardly noticed me:::: I had a strange feeling:::: I didn't expect my first day in America to be like that:::: I expected it to be better::::
 There was a little mirror in the bathroom above the sink. I remember that. I looked at my face for a long time. My eyes %eere all bloodshot that’s the word they use in English. I suppose because I hadn’t slept well the night before. With Peggy. On the boat. On the upper deck. Together all night.
    They were still drinking their tea with cookies and sugar and lemon
                                                                 When
                                                                      I
                                                                  came
                                                                    out
 Me! They gave me a glass of milk
      a tall glass of thick milk I hate that stuff I hate it I had never never drunk milk like that before I still remember the taste it had a sour taste very bad 1 took little sips just to be polite but I couldn’t finish it
 Drink your milk!                      It’s good for you
 Eat your noodles----------Eat your bread--------Eat your potatoes!
     The number of guys who hear that sort of stuff in their lifetime!
 They were eating cookies and pound cake too and they kept shoving the stuff at me                         It’s good for you they said.
 I wanted to get the hell out of there Walk the streets Alone To get lost in the big city Uncle David told them we were going to spend a few days in the big city New York He wanted to show me around We were staying with his cousins in Rockaway Beach Rockaway Beach? Yes They have a very nice little house a cottage Sounded good to me even though I couldn’t understand what they were talking about the things a guy thinks he understands when in fact he does not really understand a damn thing
                                                          That’s when
 they asked them to stay — for dinner: “Nothing much," she said Mrs. Jacobson, “in fact we’re just having noodles for dinner.”
 Imagine! It must have been past six o’clock what a day! But they really insisted about their staying for dinner even though they were only serving noodles. “And tomato sauce,” she added.
 You’ve got to stretch that scene a bit this way as they go on talking he locks himself in more and more This must be the crucial point The starting point of the silent period For three weeks A month Two perhaps He doesn't speak at all A sick feeling inside A hole Like he wants to throw up all the time
The Jacobsons are getting on my nerves. Imagine what a guy feels like when he first arrives in /inerica and he has to spend the whole afternoon ofhis first day with people like the Jacobsons.
                                  And then Detroit that comes next.
Imagine a guy. An immigrant. A Frenchman. AndaJewontop of that. Imagine. Walking along the streets of Detroit. Imagine the first two or three weeks. In Detroit. Imagine what’s going on in his mind. And you have a typical situation for a good story. Imagine how he feels. Imagine how closed in he feels. Closed up. Inside. It takes years. Five. Maybe ten. To get used to that kind of existence. And sometimes a guy never gets used to it, And eventually he kills himself or if he doesn’t have the courage to kill himself he asks somebody to do it for him. What a stinking story I
                                Depends of course on a guy’s mentality
                                             Not all foreigners are alike
                                                     Some get rich fast
                             But then there are idiots all over the world
                                       Doesn’t matter how tall they are
                             What color their hair what color their skin
                                   Neither Boris or I are very particular
                                                            Neither nor
                                              And what do you do then
                                                You save a 1000 bucks
                    Sometimes more sometimes less even 10000 bucks
                        Doesn’t matter when or where or how you got it
                                                  Then what do you do
                                              You get a room and noodles
                                          And here you are back in the noodles
                               For a foreigner it suddenly feels like you belong
                                         Of course sometimesitnever happens

 That’s closer to what
 beyond which there is a chance
  he feels at
 the beginning
 five years
 during the first
 though it usually takes ten
 to get rid of that feeling
 Even later on when he is in the army I suppose I’ll have to send him to the
                                    army—eventually—and then describe that period—it will be one of the middle chapters—200 boxes later— but it depends if he gets drafted or if he volunteers—two years in the army is alotwhenyouconsider the .shit they throw at you.
 He can’t get rid of that crummy feeling they’ll call him Frencky for sure.
 Things are shaping up:
  I have the scene on the boat
  the first meeting with Uncle David on the pier
  the subway ride
  the girl with the legs
  the afternoon with the Jacobsons
  the masturbation in the bathroom
 Things are shaping up:
 From there I’ll take them to Rockaway Beach I’ll call them Rabinowicz
              Rabinowicz that’s a good name or something like that Uncle David’s Cousins Polish Jews who came to America before the war or about that time

  It’s not too difficult to get thing going As you go along people keep popping out I now have:
  Peggy on the boat Uncle David on the pier
  The girl ananymous with the legs in the subway Thefambsonsand the other woman too in the Bronx The Rabinowicz cousins in Rockaway Beach
The girl in the subway of course is a secondary character unless I decide to make her a primary character and have Boris screw her eventually of course it won’t be easy to arrange his first day in America andUncleDavidsittingnext to himin the subway he looks asleep but it’s notcertainhe could be faking it and more important there is the language problem for Boris who doesn’t speak a damn word of English how the hell do you communicate your feelings By gestures
                             By signs By symbols By silences By simulation these are questions one must consider eventually as the characters keep popping out all over the place suddenly................................
suddenly I’ll have too many characters! Many of them won’t last of course:
 they’ll drop out they’ll fade away they’ll disappear they'll die maybe
Still that doesn’t solve the problem of the person—of the point of view:
                                                         First       Person
                                                                 or             ?
                                                         Third       Person
First Person is more restrictive
 more subjective more personal
 harder
          Third Person is more objective I could try both ways:
more impersonal
more encompassing easier
I was standing on the upper deck next to a girl called Mary...
                                                                      No Peggy.
He was standing on the upper deck next to a girl called Mary...
                                                                      No Peggy.
     comes out the same. Might be better therefore to start with a
                                       little description: The Sea
                       The Skyline of New York aaaaaaaa
                                             It was almost night...
         that’s something else Maybe the whole story should take place at night only night scenes would give it an eerie feeling
    wouldn’t work.
You could alternate:    one night scene
                             then one day scene
                       day when he is with people the subway ride the landing on the pier the Jacobsons the bathroom
                       night when he is alone
                                  loneliness and dreams the room and the factory the camp the train the farm
                       day for the outer world night for the inner self
Perhaps you should have the day scenes first and the night scenes last
    it’s more logical.
           Maybe I should write the day-scenes during the day
                       and the night scenes during the night
                                                    it would be more dramatic
Personally I don’t give a damn if it's more dramatic—I think I should simply write the damn thing straight and not—definitely—not mess around with night-scenes during the night and day-scenes during the day— doesn’t make sense particularly if I decide to work with the curtains closed then there won’t be any nights any days just electric time on top of the noodle time 365 days one after another un (111 can’t stand the damn lights and the damn noodles anymore—page after page—sentence after sentence—paragraph after paragraph—if paragraphs there are—chapters after chapters—if chapters there are—andploton top of plot—I didn’t think of that—though—plot-----------------------
Personally I don’t give a damn about plots as long as the stories move along who needs plots—plots or no plots it’s for suckers—doesn’t make any difference—it’s like the nights and the days I won’t be able to notice the difference and nobody else will either—plots are in fact useless even if plotful stories are more logical— but that does not mean that I will skip the plot in toto—I may have to consider the possibility of a minimal plot—even if it’s useless and illogical— without a plot stories read like pieces ofdiaiy and are not always credible—nobody believes what is being said—some guys in fact insist on a plot or else give up before starting—but -----------------------------------------
Personally I can do withou t and will answer those who insist on a
               plot—whomever they are—I don’t have to be specific—by saying that they are a bunch of pricks— forwhatlreallyneednowisnotaplotbut to get going to get my ass going—to write—write the damn thing and then shut up though in fact I should shut up immediately and write the thing without babbling all over the place or else the whole story is wasted— anyways you want to look at it up and down or sideways—regardless of the situation in which you have cornered yourself in order to get the damn thing started irregardlessifyou ever finish it—but -
Personally I don't give a shit if I never write the damn thing—let somebody else do it as long as I have the room to sleep in and the noodles to survive I can always lock myself in and make believe that I am doing it whereas in fact I am not doing a damn thing in the room except eating—day after day—mynoodles—crapping—my toiletpaper—wasting the time of noodles and the electric time too—making believe thatin the room alone all by myself for365 fucking daysl am composing—inventing—writing—(he greatest plotless masterpiece of all time-----------------------------

  It all boils down to the room
                         the room is at the core of the whole thing without the room nothing can be done the room is crucial the room is the starting point and the room is also the finishing point whatever the cost of the room nothing can be done without the room
                                                                                   so
                                                                                 here
                                                                                  we
                                                                                   go
416 dollars just for the room imagine that that's a lot of dough And besides
              how the hell do I get all the stuff into the room without attracting
                                                            attention ?
Unless I work all night tonight* 37 trips up & down for the noodles
                                                                     alone
     and more trips yet for the coffee sugar toothpaste salt toilet paper 52 rolls
     and all the other crap ? I need to survive on the edge of the precipice feet
                                                                                 first
Let's say approximately 10 or 15 trips up & down more should do it
They'll think I'm crazy nuts mad irrational lunatic irresponsible cracked dumb
          For indeed beyond the room one should say before there are all kinds of problems: for instance: the toilet paper—two rolls for 27 cents—Of course you get better quality for 29 cents and even better for 32 cents Butyou can't go overboard par dcularly for stuff like that since it gets flushed away anyway
                                          You could of course do it the easy way or the hard way
        the easy way is half of 52 or 26 comes out even the hard way is half of 27 or 135 comes out uneven
          either way comes out the same: 52 times 13.5
                                                    or               makes $7.02
                                               26 times 27
    ril have to make sure about that—just in case I made a mistake:
                                                        But in fact:
        It doesn’t matter in this case here since you decided on
             2 rolls a week: It simply means that I double up:
                                Double 7.02
                                                                 7.02 times 2 that’s 14 bucks .04: Exactly what I said originally exactly
Originally—when Boris first arrived in America—he never thoughthe would get so involved with such matters—and it’s not the end it’s only the beginning—take cigarettes for instance—originally Boris—or for that matter even Me—didn’t smoke either before or after he arrived in America—Never:
                       But no w I do—he does too— I do
                                              Cigarettes! Almost forgot:
        How can you survive How can you exist
        How can you work without Cigarettes?
Right now about a pack a day give or take an extra smoke here and there But under pressure could be more—a pack and a half—can’t tell now—two maybe—you could cut down of course—d

                           It was Ernest who got him started what a guy!
        Tremendous person for a black his best friend Can’t remember how they met
        Must have been in the auditorium when he heard the music All the kids blowing their horns:
                                         trumpets
                                         clarinets
                                            trombones
                                            saxophones
                                                    tremendous scene!
 What a picture!
 That’s it IH make him a sax player for a while doesn’t matter if it’s not autobiographical one can always invent a little it’s normal It's just a matter of not getting confused with what’s real and what’s not real what he realty did and what he realty did not do what he wants and what he doesn’t want
                                                Tremendous place!
Northern High School Can’t remember a single face in the place Can’t remember how he got into the place Can’t remember how he even managed to
                                                         speak
 He was just walking down the street one day in Detroit about two or three weeks later and then he saw this big building it was a school anybody in his right mind would have guessed thatjust from the look of it he walked right in Just like that and told the principal that he wanted to learn English must have been two or three weeks after he arrived In Detroit from New York after having spent a week or so in New Yorkwith Uncle David sightseeing all the big buildings the Statue of Liberty Fifth Avenue Macy’s Rockaway Beach.
 Can’t remember a single face                        exceptErnest’s!
 and some of the other guys who played with him later on weekends at 4he Blue Bird but this was a good two years later—I'm not even sure I’ll
                                                be able togetthatfar with the stoiy might run out of boxes before that noodle—
                          Tony on piano Red on guitar Kenny on bass Billy on drum Ernie on alto
                          Who the hell was on trumpet?
                          Boris eventually on tenor
                          Davis! Davis or something on trumpet
                          That makes a septet sextet without Boris
                          The Razzberry Combo
Tookhim agood two years before he could play with them regularly        but
they liked him right from the start and also there was that other kid once in a while makes it an octet with him on trombone         with a funny
Armenian name or something               Tachoukian  Kachoian real funny
Toungaian Dammit had a tremendous sound for a white guy Borisof course is white too but he learned quickly it was Mr. Lawrence who gothim started Aftertheylefttheprindpal’sofficeBorisheard themusic as diey were walking down the corridor past the auditorium       whatanoise
they were on their way to Mrs. Something’s office for the English course After he lefther officeshe was a very nice person told himhe could start right in he went back to the auditorium to listen to the sound      he just
walked into the big room guys all over the place in every comer blowing their brains out and Mr. Lawrence on the stage what a nice man he was sitting at the piano   he was white with fet cheeks and a very red nose
an enormous voice            but what a man a swell guy for a music teacher
—  What can you play?
—  Nothing.
—  That’s not much.. .ever studied music before?
—  Boris lied a little... Yes. ..in France before I came to this country.
—  You’re from France? ...what a question.
—  Boris had to tell the truth... Yes.
—  Where did you pick up your English?
—  Here and there Boris should have said .. .Euhh...
—  It’s not bad...except for the accent He must have been lying a bit too.
      Boris blushed. What a guy wouldn’t do to pass for a real American. What a
                                                                        Scenel
    —  What do you want to play?
    —  Euhh., .Anything.. .1 would prefer the trumpet
    —  Don’t have any.
If they don’t have any trumpets^ hell with it then.
    —Look in that room over there... I think there’saclarinetleft.
    —Clarinet!.. .Why not!
Yes. — Therewasaclarinetleftin thatroom overthereand that’show Boris got started on the clarinet before he switched to the saxophone tenor.. .same fingering as die alto sax explainedMr.. .Lawrence.. .I’m notgoing to argue with a music teacher particularly anice teacher like Mr. Lawrence.. .and anyway Boris was much too happy to say anything...he took his clarinet and started...squeaking onit...but in half an hour or so Mr. Lawrence taugh t him fingering and the basic Scale:—

        —Boris wouldhave preferred a trumpet or a saxophone tenor or alto it didn’t matter a bit at that time since he didn’t even know the difference.. .he felt stupid with his clarinet.. .Ernest was blowing the alto saxophone...what a sound he had on his horn...like Charlie Parker.. .that’s what or whom he said he was trying to bio w like... as.. .for Boris later on much later two or three months he did pick it up rather quickly must have had natural talent he played a bit more like Dexter Gordon particularly when he switched to the tenor sax.. .at least that’s what he said to me.. .the things a guy imagines about himself when he doesn’t know any better.. .but he was serious about it.. .1 can hear him telling me the whole story 26 or 27 boxes later—if we ever get that far:
"You know I really wanted to blow, like Dexter Gordon. Ernest sounded more like Bird on his alto until he too switched to the tenor that’s right —I almostforgot—Ernest also switchedfrom the alto to the tenor about the same time Boris bought himself his first tenor saxophone with the money he saved working in the evening in a grocery store then he started sounding more like Lester Young Indeed Lester puts more heart into it than Dexter but Dexter’s style is more modern than Lester's particularly the way he holds his horn when he blowslike some enormous phallic symbol all twistedinfront ofhim golden and superb and...”
He goes on and on like that
                telling me how he was blowing his saxophone
                          how he was holding it for a while at least eventually he went back             to holding it on the side
in front ofhim like Dexter
        because it’s more modern
                      telling me how he’s always imitating great solos and how in two or three months he was
really good
        good enough in fact to play with Ernest’s group The Razzberry Combo—“not every night at the Blue Bird but once in a while” alittle solo here & there    telling me ho w hard he worked at it 12 or 15 hours a day
no kidding in fact
                                   telling me how in fact that’s all he did most of the time that’s all he cared about most of
the time in the beginning in Detroit that stinking fucking place telling me how something had to crack to give up in that stinking fucking place telling me how sometimes he would simply play scales and chords up and down — Up & Down — for hours
                                            and hours:

12 or 15 hours a day it’s hard to believe but this was before he started working full time in the factory at Chrysler because at fir sthe only worked part-time in a grocery store                in fact at first he     doesn’t
have to have a job right away when he arrives in Detroit that stinking fucking place where his uncle took him because Uncle David helps him out the first few weeks—two or three—with a few dollars a week for the room and the food he needs to survive           buteventually he gets
a part-time job and later on a full-time job—at Chrysler—and besides he has 50 dollars with him when he arrives in America—imagine that— 50 dollars to arrive with in America that’s quite a lot of money for a foreigner—that’s why he can do what he does in the beginning:

In fact this whole business with his black friends in Detroit is extremely important—particularly his friend Ernest.. .as we shall see a lit de further on.
Detroit
Ernest
Ernest’s moth<r these are importantfacts. And indeed his first piece ofass (o) in American was ashade as j&tw# explained to him they were called. Acute litde brownish girl with an exotic name: Daisy or some name like that. No it was more Spanishy chan that: Carmen. I can always invent something. In factl’ll change all the names eventually. Has to be. Even the name of the school even the name of the music teacher Mr. Lawrence. And Mrs. Something the English teacher. I’ll change all the names. You j us t can’t go around using real names in something like that or else you’re in serious trouble. Except Emestwhat a great guy! Emit they called him wliat a fabulous guy! And very conscious ofhis race. Must be involved in the movement now. Ernie was a smart guy. Boris and hev/zK real good friends. His only friend you might say in the beginning until Boris met Joseph. But that comes in much later if ever around the end.
Joseph
Detroit
Joseph's uncle these are also important facts. I almost forgot about Joseph. That’s another guy who’ll have to come into the picture. And what a picture! Joseph. I’ll make awhole list of all the guys who eventually have to come into the picture this way I can have a nice cross section of America. Up &Dowi & Sideways. Then what I can do eventually is makepiccures huge pictures with all sorts ofpeople and all sorts of places. I’ll make a pictureon cheflooroftheroomwithmynoodleboxes. Pictures ofplaces and of things too. Like an enormous Map ofAmericavnth my noodles. Boxes all over the floor ofmy room. And thenl’llwalkon it. On the map. I’ll plunge in it. Swim init. Drown in it. Stateby State. BoxbyBox. It will be tremendous.. And after a while I’ll be able to eat the map.
Fabulous!

 50 of them that’s almost a coincidence if one were to cut down let’s say to 50 rolls one would have one roll of toilet paper for each state of the U.S. 50 rolls would be plenty but that is an entirely different problem because 50 rolls of toilet paper can’t possibly make a noodle map of America unless ♦0 rolls of toilet paper are substituted to make a toilet paper map instead 50 boxes of noodles are of course more logical even though they do not cover 52 weeks of time of noodles for indeed it would be madness to try living on 50 boxes of noodles even if the boxes are gianc size with enough for one week 50 boxes would still leave me short by two weeks which may prove essential!

Now then
This does not solve the problem ofErnest. Last anybody heard from him he had gone into the Air Force. Eventually Boris finds one of Ernest’s letters somewhere which confirms what has happened to him. And that in fact solves the problem. But at this stage Boris starts an argument with me because he does not like what I am doing to Ernest. But since I have a great advantage over Boris as his progenitor. Since I literally control his existence. If for some reason he argues with me and I find I do not like what he says to me X destroy him. One Two Three. I tear him up and throw him away.
I wipe him out. I erase him and all the rest with him. There is no point in going on with a story that doesn't satisfy both the creator and the created the teller and the told the producer and the product. That’s quite obvious. And in a way it’s an easy way out. I throw the whole thing out of the window. Noodle tomato sauce coffee typewriter toiletpaper toothpaste toothbrush Boris sugar etc. Now then
Let us continue peacefully. Til describe the whole scene in the auditorium when Boris walks in. First he looks around. Listens to the music. Stands in one corner of the big auditorium feeling somewhat embarrassed. Somewhatlike a stranger. Thenhetakeshiscourageinhishand and walks up to Mr. Lawrence. Then after that he meets some of the kids. Ernest is one of them. Ernest is immediately very friendly. Boris doesn’t like the clarinet in the beginning. But nobody else is blowing clarinet. That gives him a chance to play in the orchestra. He has in fact the whole part to himself. Three or four weeks later when he manages ^Lread music he is given a spot in the orchestra. Must have had some natural talent. Must be in the family. Hereditary. Though neither his father nor his mother played music. That’s rather curious indeed. Now then
since we are dealing with personal matters let’s make this dear right now:
         his father was a painter his mother nothing just a mother and his sisters
         do we mention the sisters or do we skip the sisters if we mention what happened to them then immediately people start feeling sorry for us it always happens when you say your sisters died the oldest one was quite a good musician played the piano six years of lessons it’s a He of course eveiybody lies a little the youngest one nothing except for a few ballet lessons
that should do for the personal matters but it’s agood place to bring it in particularly since after a while Boris invents real well all sorts of things
                                                         about his father hismother
         his sister (s)                             also
about his friend (s) Ernest
                         Joseph
for instance: the first time he gets a chance to blow a saxophone it’s Ernest who lets him use his the first time he gets a chance to drive a car it’s Joseph who lets him use his
                he uses Ernest’s mouthpiece too just wipes it a bit on
                his sleeves because it was all wet
                Hey man dig that crazy Frenchman
                that’s what Ernest says to him when he blows the sax
                for the first time
               Not boxl not bad for thefirst time
               that’s what Joseph says to him after his first driving
               lesson
               Eventually Ernest and Joseph will meet when Boris introduces them to each other but that’s much later somewhere around the 276th box
               but soon after Boris and Ernest meet in the auditorium Ernest takes Boris to his house to mee t his mother and his father and his sister
Ernests mother:          she was tremendous
                         Big&Fat but sexy as hell one night they danced together the night she had the birthday party          Boris’s birthday
                         party                      his first birthday
                         party          his first birthday in America.
If he is 19 when he arrives he must be 20
for his first birthday In America that makes sense If he arrives let's say in August or thereabout and he is 19 then his first birthday in America should be thefollowingyear
                                            that makes sense
depending of course on his birthdate
let’s assume he was bom in Taurus on May 15
then the night he danced with Ernest’s mother at the birthday party
must be the 15th of May the year after he arrived in America
                                            that makes sense It’s rather amazing in America                  that his first birthday party
               in America should have been arranged by the parents ofhis best friend his best black friend rather than by his uncle or friends ofhis unele it shows to what extent people are thoughtful and how anything can happen In America the same way anything can happen in a fictitious discourse
                                              Butstill
                             this business of giving exactdates and real names might become very tricky in the end itmightindeed be better and safer not tomention any of this because 1 have a feeling that if I go on giving specific details like these eventually they’ll think I am talking about myself <dl the time whereas in fact
this is not so   I insist on this point
                    I am invendngmostof this
therefore
who cares what they think Boris is Boris at least until
                    I decide I don’t like the name Boris anymore Butinanyevent                                      Boris is not to be confused
                                                   with a real person dead or alive
and above all not to be confosed or identified with

   That’s good enough
   itwas almost two o’clock in the momingwhen they started dancing and that’s about when Boris began to realize that she wan ted him that he wan ted her that perhaps she wouldn’t mind getting screwed by him He could feel her big thighs against his legs through the thin material of her dress she must have been completely naked under the thin summer dress
   with flowers all over it was summer no i t was spring since he was bom in May May 15 to be exact nice month Taurus good sign has to be spring (hen it must be
   a spring dress she’s wearing unless she wears summer dresses in spring because she can’t afford spring dresses in spring that’s possible but it’s an entirely different matter which should not enter in to play at this time
   but whatever die case itwas a very thin dress and I am sure she could feel him too
   rigid and clumsy ready to explode at any momentright through the thin dress That’s good enough
^Abouta dozen people were present at the party: Ernest
                                                           Boris of course Ernest’s mother Ernest’s father nice guy Ernest’s sister 14years old
                                                  that makes five what you could then there was:
                                             Two buddies of Ernest with their girl friends and two other buddies without their girl friends
                                            that makes six more what you could
call the close friends of the family
                                             And then there was the American kid who plays trombone
                                            that makes with Boris two white guys and ten colored all together exacdy a dozen.
Earlier in the evening some other people had dropped in for the cake with the twenty candles but left immediately after the cake thus you might say that by the time they started dancing only the family and die close friends of the family were left everybody was in a good mood except for one person Ernest’s father who had fallen asleep on the Hvingroom couch but that does not mean that he was in a crummy mood on the contrary itsimply indicates that he was loaded which is not unusual at birthday parties and this way things are much simpler for everybody and particularly for Boris even thoughnothingreallyhappened thatnightexcepcthat they danced until about four in the morning and by then Boris was certain that she wanted him like mad even though she had not said so explicidy but kepc rubbing her big thighs against his clumsy rigidity right through the thin material ofher dress Boris was ready to explode instantly in his shorts like a motherfucker butfinallynothinghappenedthatcanbeinterpretedinabadway no nothing except that when Boris finally got home he couldn’t stand it anymore and masturbated a good one in front of the mirror hanging above the sink in his bathroom on his toes with the picture of Ernest’s mother’s enormous ass in front ofhis eyes but it was only an illusion the real ass was asleep next to Ernest’s father drunk like hell in their double bed in Ernest’s apartment while Ernest was screwing gendy the girl friend of one of his friends who came to the party on the backseat ofhis father’s 1948 Buick basically then chis is how the birthday party ended
Butthereal thing between Boris and Ernest’s mother happened some four or sixweeks later 12
                      so before this was almost the end of June but he’d been busy given him of course he should by all means have done thank Ernest’s mother for the lovely birthday party they had mind he had made up his mind to stop by Ernest’s pad and hands and Boris left but not for home because in the back ofhis tonight to digsomc sound crazy man said Ernest and they shook suppose but I’ll see you later man maybe we’ll go to the Bluebird going man oh just noplace in particular answered Boris home I Finally then when Boris left the station Ernest asked where you
                      up the house or doing the laundry always does on Saturdays I suppose answered Ernest without noticing the blushing cleaning blushing a little as he asked and your mother where is she she’s home or something like doing the laundry but to make sure Boris asked game then Emest’smothermustbehome alone deaningup thehouse Emcstis notlyingabouthis father andsister having gone to thebaseball is but a step to deduce that if Ernest is working in the gasstadon and baseball game with Emest’ssis ter becauseEmesttoldhim so and there working and in fact he knew also that Ernest’s father had gone to a the day he decided to screw Ernest’s mother he knew Ernest was that he would stop by the gas station and bullshit with Ernest so that the job in thegfocery store then he too worked onSaturday butbefbre visited Ernest in his gas station that is before he quit Chiysler and got worked in the gas station sometimes when Boris did not work he a Saturday on Saturday Boris did not work at Chrysler but Ernest day in the gas station Boris was not working that day must have been the comer however since itwas summer vacation Ernest worked all where he usually works after school a Mobil gas station just around party Boris knew that Ernest was working that day in the gas station this is howithappened inj uneabout two three weeks after thebirthday regularly than before even ifithad to be with Ernest’s mother basically he felt he had entered his manhood and therefore needed sex more loneliness and of guilt a period when having passed his 20 th birthday it was for Boris the beginning of a period of deep introspection of and screwing Ernest’s mother was indeed a difficult action to admit edly forgive whatever you do that is immoral such as screwing mo thers even though friends are persons you can abuse persons who suppos friend that he had made it with his mother and it’s understandable ofhis father’s car however Boris didn’t have the courage to tell his told Boris that he had screwed his friend’s gtrl friend on the back sear friendship when they told each other everything for instance Ernest 15 boxes later sometime in June when Boris and Ernest had reached that stage in their
Better (ate than never that’s what he
told himself I’ll tell her I’ve been busy
like hell and that he really hadn’t had
the time to stop by to thank her for the               soft
lovely party she had given him for his
birthday and what a delicious cake she
had made for him and how apprecia
tive he was of the whole evening and particularly how he enjoyed the
                               way they danced together he'll throw that in just to see If she reacts and then he’ll play it by ear and see what hap soft               pens next and he began to get all
                               excited while walking towards Ernest’s pad feeling himself already rigid and clumsy inside his pants as he walked faster and faster around the comer towards his mother She was a bit like a mother to him too after all he is an orphan with a rather curious upbring ing but still it’s not easy to fuck your bestfriend’smotherjustlikethatmight                  normal
be pushlnga little maybe a sister that’s almost normal but Ernest's sister is only 14 years old that’s really immoral
and his father what a nice guy what a disgusting mentality Boris has
                               and particularly since Ernest’s father was so nice to him and to Ernest too sometimes he would let Ernest have normal              the old 1948 Buick and one day in a
                                park Ernest told Boris you want to try man he showed him what to do and for a while Boris drove the car around the
parkwhat a sensation itwas really very
exciting as he walks up the stairs he
can feel it harder and harder I can’t go
on like that I can’t wandering all over        hard
the place getting all worked up about
somethingwhich might never happen I
would do better getting back to my list
and not waste any more time fucking around with Boris’s best friend’s
                            motherperhaps eventually I’ll get there around the 256th box but until then stick with the toilet paper the tooth hard              brush the coffee the soap sugar salt
                            tomato sauce the wall paper and the horses and forget about Ernest’s mother it’s all an illusion a fiction a lie the onfytruthnowis the noodtesNothing else but the noodles and the toilet paper I did that though I really never decided how many wipes in a roll one grabs a handful three or four sheets at a time who the hell counts           sticky
who the hell would be crazy enough to measure three or four fistfuls for each crap sometimes more when it’s sticky
but otherwise useyourjudgment stilll should try one rolljust to see or
                            at least time one shit and then decide from that not a bad idea but I really don’t need to go now I went this mom sticky                ingwaituntUtomorrowbutthenltUbe
                            too late tomorrow morning I begin Oc tober First and that’s it quite regu lar about that one crap a day does it

 First let's see how much there is altogether: must have walked out of
                                                  there with at least 1200 bucks if I am correct but some of it was spent:
                                                       the room in Vegas the food on the road the bus fare the magazines the candy bars
                                                       a good fifty bucks or maybe even more
 It’shard to keep track even though I must have counted that money at least 20 times. Make a list. A pack of cigarettes here and there and each time another buck shot to hell. Must have spent over ahundred bucks since Los Angeles. Where did it all go? Yes where? That’s a good question at a time               y
 like this. Besides the bills I still have a bit of change left. 87       d
 cents exactly counting pennies. Can one make it on that for            o
 a year? Some people manage on less. So many guys in the b world who manage on less than one thousand a year. It’s o ' pitiful when you think of it But who thinks of these guys N
 Forget it. Start adding up again. Got to keep it straight. Single space
                                       and down the line:

Now we go for the Total the grand total up to this point Is everybody ready?

    Correct. So far then conditionally I have spent exactly in dollars and cents; 574.91. Of course if you add in French it comes out the same eventually but it’s much easier particularly for a guy like Boris. It’s not ^ unusual for a foreigner to add and calculate and do his multiplication tablesinhis original language—his native tongue—even after he’s been in the country for twenty years and knows the language fluently. It's a very common practice. The number of guys who still calculate in their native tongue in America is a real phenomenon. Unbelievable. Polish

German Greek Italian Yiddish of course Hungarian etc. For Boris of course it’s French:
         cinq et quatre neuf et cinq quatorze et neuf vingt-trois etcinq vingt-huit etneuf trent-sept et quatre quarante-et-un et je retiens quatre quatre et huit douze et encore une fois huit vingt et quatre vingt-quatre et cinq vingt-neuf et deux trente-et un et huit ?a fait trente-neuf etje retiens troistrois etsix neufplus cinq quatorze et sept vingt-et-un trente et quatre trente-quatre etje retiens trois trois et un quatre et deux six et un sept etje ne retiens rien quatre et un cinq voila c’est fini et on arrive au meme grand TOTAL: 574.91
It’s just a question of being careful and of not goofing in your additions down the line and of course ofkeeping track of all the numbers you must <§(irryover,/ere£eeRs inFrertc/i after thateverythingfallsinplacemore or less and you have a total not necessarily a grand total since we are only in the middle of the discourse and there is more a great deal more to come Unbelievable in fact how much more there is to come. And that’s without counting all the different drafts tous les brouillons and versions.
                                  Most important then is to keep moving therefore assuming that so far I have estimated approximately 574.91 of my expenses and assuming that I had about 1100 bucks left from my 1200 when I arrived in New York give or take two or three cents here and there but assuming I round it off to 1100 even including the 87 cents in change I know I have for sure and
            I            divide that 1100 by 52 then that gives me exactly to the fourth decimal 23.2692 a week it’s not an even number but it’s a beautiful number to live on a week and even if I round it off to 23 point 27 that’s a nice little sum of money when you think of it 23 dollars and 27 cents is better than nothing especially when you consider the number of guys who live on less you are indeed in better shape than most Boris for instance lived on less About 20 dollars a week when he first arrived but quite true his room was taken care of by his uncle at least for the first few weeks before he got the job full time the afternoon shift from four to midnight at Chrysler then he started paying for his room himself but until he got his first pay check Uncle David paid for this rented room It was only five bucks a week in those days Five bucks including kitchen privileges but what a stinking room in Detroit with a Hungarian family Yes it's always the room that creates the problem the damn room in my case 8 bucks a week leaves me 15 bucks or so 15.2692 or 15.27 if I round it off 8 bucks a week for a room it’s really something 6 would be tremendous for all the rest of the stuff and that’s without counting the stuff I might get free or even figuring in an emergency fund How the hell can a guy survive on the edge of the precipice falling in feet first hanging on by my fingernails horses flying all over and noodles all around noodles for breakfast lunch and dinner all in one pot What a situation Where the hell did it all start Must have been in Los Angeles after the poker game or else on the bus or somewhere else Perhaps when I was working as a dishwasher in a cafeteria and couldn’t take it
                                    anymore Not bad that should hit them hard Dishwasher that’s a good one for Boris It’ll go into the list of jobs Boris gets All the crummy jobs he gets during his first year in America Unbelievable the number of crummy jobs one gets when one first arrives in America I’ll have to remember that The list of jobs Now I remember it was in New York when I was living with Loulou and not in Los Angeles I was mistaken all this time The noodle idea was conceived originally before Los Angeles yes in New York with Loulou when he and I shared a room in the Bronx which in those days cost only 6 bucks a week for two and we did our own cooking That left us a little less than 10 dollars a week for food transportation and entertainment I was making 15.75 a week Loulou was not working he was a painter It was I poor sonofabitch who did all the work and the cooking too Who supported the two of us with my 15.75 a week 15.75 clear that is after all the deductions Slaving like a jerk as a dishwasher but that included lunches and of course also all the food I smuggled out of the place for Loulou That lazy bum he refused to work just like that He was a painter An artist and he didn’t want to get his hands dirty but he ate like a pig Eventually he and Boris became buddies but after the end this story Therefore Loulou doesn’t really come into the picture But still what an appetite With less than 10 bucks a week we really had to stretch Therefore noodles was the only food we could afford Noodles for breakfast lunch and dinner except that during the week I was better off for lunch than Loulou I had all sorts of choices inmy cafeteria But on weekends noodles all day long Must have been when the whole noodle idea was conceived From my days with Loulou in New York living it up on noodles with less than 10 bucks a week for the two of us but Loulou used to tell me not to worry that someday we’ll laugh at the whole thing and when you’re famous you’ll write a book about it a big book about noodles and rooms and New York Boris and America
I really Liked Loulou toobadhe doesn’t come into this story because Boris mee ts him much later after this s tory is finishedbutwhataguyLoulouIwould do anything for him smuggle all sorts of goodies for him ham sandwiches he loved ham potato salad too and especially pies apple pies he had a passion for apple pies in my pockets the stuff dripping like hell inside my
                                  pants in the subway on my way home to the Bronxjuicy crushed apples what a mess... what a mess indeed I hope Boris does not have to go through all that shit with Loulou but even if he does it’ll be a damn good experie nee for him but of course it does not have to happen in New York it can happenjustanywhere in Americayou don’t have to be specific there
are cafeterias all over doesn’t even have to happen in Detroit after all Boris doesnot stay in Detroithiswhole life eventually he takes off and slowly works his way to the West Coast... Los Angeles and then back East to New York where it all started a kind of circular journey Journey to Chaos remember University of California Press 1965 and finally he dies that’s
                                    a beautiful ending he dies of starv ation in a crummy furnished room in the Bronx a circular story from beginning to end from room to room or better yet from boat to boat boat to boat is better than from room to
                                    room makes more sense..............
                                    and besides this way he does not die and he goes on to the end and in between meets Loulou yes and
eventually he makes up his mind to takeoffbyboathecan’ttakeitanymore America is for the big birds that’s what he tells himself I’m fed up I’m going back to France or better yethe decides that France is also for the birds and he goes to Africa to livewith his aunt and work in her big hotel at leas t this gives great unity to his life and to the stoiy...but of course he
                                    never leaves never finds the kind of courageoneneedstoleaveand therefore he stays in Americafor the rest ofhis life but in between Loulou comes into the picture and that's why it is necessary to say a few words about Loulou even ifhe doesn’t appear at all in this portion of the stoiy butsomebody someday might want to use Loulou for another story so one page only one on Loulou
Loulou was six feet tall with a tremendous appetite sort of blondish an enormous hooked nose very white teeth a square chin and bushy hair on his chest he always wore suspenders even at night with his pyjamas it was so fanny I could not stop giggling in our double bed with his ice cold feet shoved against my ass he was not a bad painter an abstract painter he rarely came out of the room during the daytime while I went to work in my cafeteria he stayed home and painted the room every week the room changed color one week the place was all black the following week all pink the entire spectrum of the rainbow in the course of time but best was the week he went wild and decided to do it in multicolor he did the ceiling bright yellow and each of the four walls in a different diabolical color one wall was dark brown an other purple the one with the window he did orange and bottle green the one with the door the place looked fabulous but the landlady was furious when she came up that Sunday morning to collect the rent she almost threw us out but I managed to calm her down by telling her that it was temporary another time Loulou painted all the furniture fire engine red it was not bad in fact quite an improvement and since he had quite a bit of paint left over he also did the bath-
room in red everything the sink the shitpot the pipes and even the mirror it was very sexy but it got to a point where I would dream in technicolor and the damn paint did cost me a lot of money it had to come out of the money we had left after the rent was paid the rent always came first then the noodles seven boxes a week 29 cents a box for a total of two dollars and three cents the rest of the money was for transportation entertain ment and Loulou’s paint ev eiy Saturday after I came home from work we would take the subway downtown to buy the paint at the same time we would catch a movie on Forty-second street in those days you could get in cheap 75 cents which normally would have been a dollar fifty for the two of us but somehow Loulou always managed to sneak into the place quite a guy Loulou of course we avoided as much as possible eating out unless we couldn’t take it anymore then we would grab a quick hot dog after the movie which we shared equally two bites apiece was all a guy could getbut itwas delicious ♦nth a lot of mustard Loulou always took the first bite I the second he the third and I the fourth but by the fourth bite there was very little left but I didn’t mind because I loved Loulou and I think Loulou loved me too and Boris too too bad I cannot use him
Too Bad! Really too bad that it is in the part of Boris’s life which does not
come into this story that Loulou and thereafter Loulou and
                                                                                       extensively - all over the country circularjourneys:
First they meet in and then they move to and after that it’s
butdon’tforgetto stop in and finally it all ends in
New York Detroit Chicago Chicago LosAngeles San Francisco Las Vegas New York
                                                                                      Boris eventually meets
                                                                                       Boris travel together-
from East to West from West to East everybody does
one always goes through on the way West to with a little detour by and then Eastward again for the crap game in a furnished room
withnoodles all around and flying horses all over writinga circular story.
        What a journey
                journey to chaos a circular journey
                                                                                          a journey to the end of the noodles to the end of the story a circular story
                                       a story that never ends since he cannot find the courage to leave
                         the courage necessary to go back to France or to go down to Afri ca but should he have found that kind of courage this is approximately what wouldhave gone oninhis mind inFrench
                                                           in French
because most foreigners when faced with a serious decision think in their original language—in Boris’s case French:

And so, having decided that Boris would spend the rest ofhis life in America, there was nothing else to do but go on and on to an end, especially since eventually he too would lock himself in a room with noodles to crap out his existence on paper 52 rolls; but the money had to come from somewhere, if not some poker game in Los Angeles, then some crap game in Las Vegas can’t be both though there is still the possibility that the money was stolen—borrowing is out of the question, takes too much involvement and all sorts of collaterals to get it—stolen money is not a bad idea, on the way back I don’t have the time to describe the whole trip but it’s implied, instead of gambling, or instead of borrowing,heknockedupknockeddown,knocked out?,shit,hehitsomeguy on the head in Vegas that’ll teach him a lesson, and headed for Chicago, no New York, and when he arrived by bus he had about 1100 dollars left in his pocket. And so, the first thing he thinks of doing is grab a boat, and even a plane, anything, and get the hell out of this fucking country, back to France, even though this would ruin the whole set up, mess up the circular aspect of the trip, but who wants to be locked up in a crummy room for 365 days or 52 weeks when one can be enjoying life with 1100 bucks or so, in Paris, yes walking up & down the Champs-Elysee, the Eiffel Tower, Saint-Germain, Montparnasse, even the Riviera. With that kind ofmoney a guy can do almost anything he wants
                                               rien n’est impossible a Vhomme, in fact a guy could easily write the whole story in French or even in two languages at the same time simultaneously withparenthesis:
                                                      Hier Boris est arrive a New York Yesterday Boris arrived in New York. Upleuvait It was raining. Son oncle l’attendait au bateau avec une belle voiture His uncle was waiting for him at the boat with a beautiful car. H avait rencontre une fille bien sur le b&teauHehadmetanice girl during thetripon the boat. Unfild'Ariane An Ariade thread. Une fille de Milwaukee A girl from Milwaukee. Ussesontaimes They loved each other. Et ils ont pleura un petit peu quandilsse sontsepares souslapluie And they wepta little when they said goodbye under the rain mais elle lui a promis de lui ecrir e regulierement et en anglais surtout But she promised to write him regularly and in English mostly des qu’il serait installe a Detroit as soon as he would be settled in Detroit.
                                                      C’Stait touchant It was sad.
                                                  One could last a good six months like that if one were to watch out every penny carefully. Six months living it up cooked up in a room with noodles for breakfast lunch and dinner and tomatosauceonceinawhile. For what? A guy would go crazy. Six months like that is madness! Imagine what a year 12 months—365 days would be like. It would be impossible to keep it up. A guy would die. And then they would find the manuscript unfinished and unimproved in the middle of the noodles: The Diary of a Madman in English—Histoire d’un fou in
                                                  French. I can already see the guy two or three months later with a
                      ""1          beard down  to his waist walking around the room like an animal in a
                                   cage. Horses flying inside his head. Skinny like a noodle. Dirty filthy disgusting raving. Eyes bulging out ofhis head. Weak sick. Banging onthewallswithhisfists. Vomitinghis life inside the noodle boxes. For what? A lousy 1100 bucks approximately! Doesn’t make sense. Would be so easy for him to get a boat ticketone way only and spend six lovely months in Paris. Six months on 1100 dollars that gives him approximately 900 perhaps a little less ifhe buys himself a new suitcase for the trip suitcases are important as we shall see still that’s a lot of
                                   money. He could live quite comfortably for six months on that Life is cheaper there. There a guy can easily get aroom for three bucks a week that’s without a bath of course but who cares. 52 times 3 makes only 156 bucks. Lots of guys did it that way. Hemingway. The lost generation. That doesn’t mean though that the guy would be lost. On the contrary. And noodles are cheaper there too. Easily 20 cents a pound if not less instead of 29 and that’s without figuring the possibility of a devaluation of the franc. Working conditions are better too. One could get a room with a view on rooftops or on the Seine with Notre-Dame in the background perhaps in the Latin Quarter and bien entendu the whole thing would have to be written in French in a much more conventional manner.
But again a guy could forget about the whole thing forget about Paris and the Champs Elysees and Montparnasse and the Eiffel Tower and Rue Saint-Denis avec tous ses bordels forget about writingitin French or in English and simply spend the money on himself buy himself a new suit and a new tie to go with the new suit a pair of shoes or two a belt and clean underwear and socks silk and wool socks for the winter
and the hell with the months later he there in the guts ize what he has done to show nothing no wasted time and deep down his well his guts where it feeling of emptiness ure and of his frus would realize how how better off he lock himself in the squandering away clothes on movies of ass or even eating restaurants that’s ize six months later late of course as he his existence from new suit ready to his new tie because money and no story couldhave writtenin the guts to lock him his life and his further discussion liberation digression ply saying to himself straight into the
story but then six would feel it right when he would real that there is nothing story nothing but wasted money and dressed soul inside hurts nothing but a the hollow ofhis fail tration then he stupid he had been would have been to room instead of his 1100 bucks on cheap novels pieces plentifully in good what he would real if not sooner but too would contemplate the hollowness ofhis hang himself with there is no more no lovely story he the room if he had self in the room with noodles without any without further de hesitation just sim tomorrow we begin room and we stick
 with it down the line and up and down one box a day twelve pages ^day 365 days and no more fucking around it starts in New York on the boat with Peggy and Uncle David waiting on the pier it’s raining always rains on days like these makes it more human more real particularly when the three of them start crying like idiots on the pier not knowing why how beautiful yes that’s the way to go all the way

 like cauliflower yes definitely the room or rooms will become symbolic after awhile smell always the same like there’s been a dead rat in the wall for mon ths or else it smells down to describing them dirty filthy and much too expensive for what they are and the plain white but basically all rooms all furnished rooms look the same when it comes your ass ac night that’s a good touch and shitty wall paper though it doesn’t have to be in New York with the table by the window and only one chair and bedbugs chewing room rooms all over all over the country something like the place I had when I arrived self then I’ll have to invent something else perhaps a symbol or two for instance the all because he’s not that smart and secondly because he doesn’t want to reveal his inner objective especially if he cells his own story he cannot afford to analyze himself first of psychological problems yes definitely no psychology everything on the surface very obsession it’s hard to get rid of it you get all wrapped up with all sorts of cheap to his life or perhaps something like an obsession but that’s tricky once you have an every thing will fall in place particularly as soon as I find some sort of theme to give unity on other guys will come into the picture this way things will keep going and eventually beginning in fact there should be only Peggy and Uncle David that’s so and only later him off the boat that’s for sure can’c have too many people in the beginning in the you get involved with all these guys you’ll never get the story going and you’ll never get sounds beautiful to him but of course he never sees any of these guys again because if see me if you ever come to Nebraska Kansas Texas lots of guys from Texas California naive everybody does in thebeginningsome of them give him their addresses come and do in America and how he’s going to love it they make fun ofhim too because he’s so Peggy she’s alrigh t bu t there are o tber guys on the boat too who tell him what he sho uld anywhere for example on the boat he meets quite a number ofpeople besides Peggy meet them somewhere else anything can happen in this type of discourse anything truebutDetroitisimportantbecause ofall the people he meets there of course he could time the time a guy wastes in a lifetime sleeping most of the time or taking craps that’s back to New York to finish the circular journey this way I would not waste too much skip Detroit and have him work his way to Los Angeles that would work too and then York that’s a tremendous scene and after that the Jacobsons in the Bronx and then you scenes inNew York that’s essential the boatscenequickly then thesubway scene inNew work his way West immediately with a stop in Milwaukee to see Peggy but first the then after that they split up and it’s Detroit though I could skip Detroit and have him I can already see the whole scene the three of them weeping like idiots on the pier and

                                            it’ll be interesting to know what he brings without going into all the details what he brings with him to America from the old coun try a kind of summary of his former life also what he reads at that time later on things will change a guy can’t stay the same his whole life that’s for sure at 19 he's somebody else than what he is or will be at 29 therefore make a list of all the things in his suitcase until there is nothing left from what he originally brought with him when he first arrived on the boat with his suitcase
        Everything. Until there is nothing left except for one or two small souvenirs he can’t get rid of. It’s normal. For sentimental reasons. And then even these disappear eventually. Always happens. He loses them. And by the time there is nothing left from the original things that were in his suitcase and in his pockets when he arrives in America then he should be at the end ofhis story. At least at the end of the firststage of the story ofhis life. In America, Things happen fast in America, It completes the cycle. He is now totally American. From shoes and socks to haircut Even though he still speaks with an accent Takesyears to get rid of your French accent That’s very symbolic. Suitcases too could be symbolic. He carries his life in his suitcase. Now it’s taking shape. Rooms. Suitcases. Funny how things begin to happen when you start talking about rooms. First you have to describe the furniture. The table. The chair. By the window. But with suitcases it’s even better. You can really spend hours describing all the things a guy has in his suitcase when he firstarrives someplace. And it doesn’t even have to be in America. Everybody has a suitcase somewhere in his room. Even imaginary rooms and imaginary suitcases work the same way. Things always happen in them. Suddenly there is a mirror in the room and that mirror suddenly gives an added dimension to the room and of course to the whole story. Like in thatother story; and I followed my shadow. A long time ago. The kids walk into the room. On the farm. A dirty filthy room. He hasn’t seen himself in a mirror for almost five years. Sounds incredible but it’s true. He gets undressed. Naked. He stands in the middle of the room. And bang he sees himself in the mirror.
 What ashock! Adisgusting
 picture of himself, A theme! And
 after that everything begins to fell in place
 soon. After all these years. Asymbol. When he sees
 himself in the mirror after all these years. Five years. Can’t
 believe it It was like he was bom again. Reborn. First he didn’t
 recognize himself. He had grown much taller. Skinny as hell though. So
 skinny it was frightening. That’s the curious thing about this story. Even
 when you’re starving you go on growing. In spite of the camp and
 the suffering. I mean when you’re a kid. But he was only
 twelve when they shipped him to the camp. Five
 years later he was seventeen. Doesn’twork
 too well butit’ll do fornow. In any
 event it won’t come into
 this story. But you could
 use the mirror. I suppose if you
 didn’tkeep on growingyou wouldn’tfeel
 the hunger as much. Then you would stay amidget
 your whole life. Gan a guy shrink? After five or six months
 of noodles I might begin to shrink. Fortunately I don’ grow
 anymore these dap. Except of course for the beard down to my waist and
 the hair down to my shoulders. Christ-like almost. Naked in the room.
 After a while if the heat is good I could work naked. Saves a lot
 on clothing and laundry. Naked in the middle of the
 room. But what about the mirror? Must be one.
 All furnished rooms have mirrors. In
 the bathroom usually above the
 sink. Obviously. There’s
 always a litde mirror above
 the sink. But not necessarily in the
 room proper. However if I do without clocks.
 Without newspapers. Radio. Telephone. And so on.
 Why a mirror? I should do withouta mirror too. Definitely. If there is one cover it up with a blanket Might be unbearable. Mirrors give alitde dimension to aroom. Alitde depth. Three-dimensional depth. Then when you have nothing else to do you look at yourself in them.
If you look at yourself in the mirror as though you were somebody else, if you make faces at yourself in the mirror, that should occupy time for a while, and this way, between scenes, and boxes, you can observe your own suffering, because a guy always suffers in situations such as these, it’s normal, particularly Boris, that poor kid, after he jumped off the train during the war one night and fell into a ditch where a farmer found him, and they put him in a room, naked, a nice sunny room in a farm house I was working on the description of the room — in those days I still fucked around with descriptions — and I had all the furniture almost in place, including the table by the window, nothing to rave about, just crummy old furniture in a farm house, but compared with what Boris had in the camp it was almost paradise, and that’s when the idea of putting a mirror in the room came to me, and the first thing he did when he got in the room, after he looked around, a bit scared, was to jerk off, or at least he was starting to do it, holding on to it with his left hand, when he saw himselfin the mirror, and that’swhen theshockcame, the shock of not recognizing himself, after all these years, five years, because he had changed so much, much taller, but skinny like hell, his stomach sticking out, his eyes bulging out, he really looked atrocious standing there in front of the mirror with his erect dick in his hand, and yet he suddenly almost as in a dream became aware of himself, aware of being alive instead of being dead, as he saw himself, or at least someone he though twas himself, in the mirror, because everyone has an idea of himself in his mind, and even though he did no trecognize himself, itmade him aware ofhimself atsome differentstage ofhis life, ofbeing someone else other than what he was before the camp, and this awareness, this self-recognition of what one is, but not necessarily of what one was, or the idea of what one thinks one is, because everybody has an idea of oneself in one’s mind at one time or another, and I suppose Boris did too, or will have an idea of himself in his mind of course I’ll be the one who will create that idea of himself in his mind, but first I’ll have to create him before the idea can be there, or does it work the other
way around, first the idea and then the man himself, that’s a very tricky point, it’s almostimpossible to know, for in fact you cannot explain that which you do not knowin advance, and therefore it is up to the guy who reads the discourse to determine that fact, but that does not necessarily mean that it is a philosophical point, it can merely be a fictitious point, because only in fiction, and not in reality, does such problems arise, otherwise life would be unbearable, and it is already hard enough to cope with it, but Boris has a rather fuzzy idea of himself in his mind, and this is why he is so unstable, butif there is one thing about Boris that is typical or for that matter about every guy in his situation, guys who come to America, it’s his loneliness, his inclination towards loneliness, of course, but everybody is lonely, doesn’ t matter where you are, never fails, people do not admitit publicly, butin private most of them are scared shitless of their loneliness, and what do they do, for instance, they lock themselves in a crummy room, for 365 days, without even considering the consequences, all alone, and try to spit out their lives, or the idea of their lives, on paper, thinking that this way they will exorcise their inner-self, or the equivalent of it, butin the end it does not work, they remain the same as before, it’s insane, it’s notlogical, butif there is amirror in the room, even a small mirror above the sink in the bathroom, I’Ukeep it, justfor the company, just to have somebody to look at, butl won’t go out, that’s for sure, out of my way to buy one, can’t afford it, I have enough trouble with all the restofthe stuff, thefoodin particular, to start bothering about a mirror, that’s for sure at this stage, and this is why the whole thing has to be planned in advance or else it falls apart, systematically, like the plan of an attack, exacdy, because the least litde error canmessup the whole setup, andifthathappensyou’re finished, dead, and everybody else with you, therefore, assuming he is 19 when he first arrives in America then if I register him in high school, he’s already too old to be at ease with the other kids, even though in his case it’s only for courses in English for foreign students, government, history and a bit of physical education but he does feel the difference, it’s normal.
It's like an attack

 Uncle David was furious. Or else he was asleep. But that doesn’t prevent the girl from staring at the suitcase between Boris’s legs. Particularly since He’s staring between her legs. She was sitting her legs slightly spread apart in a rather sensual position. Just across from him. But he has to slide down in his seat a little to get a better look. Uncle David’s head keeps tilting sideways. You couldn’t tell from where Boris is sitting if he is asleep for sure.
 No better yet. He’s not asleep. He’s reading a newspaper. Wide open in front ofhim. The Jewish Daily Forward. Then a guy comes in at one of the stops. He stands right in front of the girl hanging on to a porcelain loop. Boris can’t see anything anymore. Just the top of the knees. But the guy moves sideways. Not consciously. Just enough to hide the girl’s face but not the legs. So now Boris can see much better than before and she cannot see him. Perfect.
 The man’s belly is right in front of her face. His belly or his dick depending how tall he is. Now he can really see between her legs well. Almost all the way up. At least way above where the stockings stop. This way also with the guy in front he can really look without being noticed by the girl. He suddenly gets all excited. All of America is there. Between her legs. He can feel it in his pants but he has his hands crossed on his lap. Nobody can see it.
 All this time he’s thinking about everything that happened to him since early morning. The arrival of the boat. Peggy. The customs ^gent who asked him numerous questions. His suitcase. Uncle David. All the people on the pier. Thousands of them. New York. The tall buildings. That’s a lot of things to think about for one day. And the day is not over yet. And on top of that the strange feeling inside. All sorts of images in his mind. Mixed feelings inside.
And on top of that the girl's crotch in front ofhim. America the crotch! It's more than he can take for his first encounter with America. The great confrontation. The enormous cuntfrontation.The giantcro/c/i. Why beat around the bush. Say it straight. Loud and clear. He has an enormous —a gigantic— a fabulous — erection inside his pants. That's not nice for a guy who just arrived in America but it's understandable. I could list all the reasons and mixed feelings he feels inside. People would should understand:
                           Anguish
                           Fear
                           Hesitation
                           Loneliness
                           Anxiety
                           Homesickness
                           Alienation
                           Shit! How do you show all that? In a sense it's almostimpossible. How doyou show all tha tin a sentenceor two. Just can't say it outright. You have to show it. Make people feel it. It's a bit like being lost No. It's like being scared. Scared like a rabbit being chased by a dog. But you don't want to show it. Nobody does. Therefore you make believe it's tremendous. Beautiful. A happy experience. A dream. The confrontation. You love it. I love it. We love America! At least the first few days.
                                       But it takes a good five years and even sometimes ten to get used to it How do you like it here? The eternal question they all ask. How long have you been in this country? The second question they all ask. They must have asked those two eternal questions at least million times for the last century. The same two questions to all the poorslobs whocame to America. Even twenty years later they ask the same two fucking questions. Do you like it here? How long have you been in this country? Sometimes with slight variations. Sometimes asking the second question first and the first second. They ask you as soon as they pick you

 Oh it’s fine. Oh it’s really good. Oh it’s hard to get used to it in the beginning. Oh sometimes you get lonely but eventually things work out. Oh I really like it here but it took me a while to learn the language. Oh! That' 8 what you say most of the time. And on top of that you always lie a little about the number of years you've been in the country. Sounds better to say Oh just a few years! Three or four is a good number. Because if you say you’ve been in this country ten years then they don’t feel sorry for you anymore. It’s normal.
                             Usually in the beginning they ask the eternal questions of your uncle or whoever brought you to this country. Uncle David for Boris. Because they know you don’t speak the language well. How does he like it here? How long has he been here? And. the uncle answers for you. Uncle David answers the eternal questions for Boris in the beginning. Gives him a chance to feel proud for having brought his nephew to America.
             Boris imagined Uncle David quite differently. Not as old first of all. Tall like his father was or at least how tall he remembers his father was. More American too. Thinking is a difficult process for Boris in the beginning. Particularly since he doesn’t know what to think about. Souffrir c’est penser. That’s one of the things he thinks about That’s a good one. He had heard that somewhere in France before he came and he keeps throwing it in.
                     Once in a while you wonder who is thinking. Must be Boris. As a matter of fact he only thinks in French during the first few months. After a while he begins to think in both languages. Simultaneously sometimes. What a confusion. Takes a long time to start thinkingstraightinEnglish. Particularly whenyou’re lonely. But ^ou can’t have him think in French all the time. Or any time he wants to in the middle of the story. Doesn’fcmake sense. Unless I translate for him. Translate everything he says or thinks during his first year in America. To think is to suffer. It’s a good one even though it’s backward.
 Souffrir c’estpenser                                          To think is to suffer
 Penser c 'est souffirin                works                  To suffer is to think

                                           i

 He didn’t invent it. He simply heard it or read it somewhere. He’s full of crap like that. But I’ll translate everything. Except once in awhile a few sentences in French here and there to make it look more realistic and also more genuine. But even then you’ll have to give some kind of approximation for people who don’t read French. Except when he uses bad     obscenities
 : Ah ce qu’on se fait chier ici:             :Quelle saloperie d’existence:
 : Quel bordel de putain de pays:               : Les am<£ricans sont des cons:
 : Ah la belle blague l’Am&rique:               : Qu’ils aillent se fair voir:
 Things like that you can’t translate. But it’s better than nothing. It’s a question of style. It’s natural ifyou want to give the story a sense of reality. For instance in the subway he thinks in French. And he sees all sorts of dirty images in his mind and describes them to himself in F rench. And what’s even worsesome of these images seem to gather between T the gjrl’slegp. Right there in the spot he’s staring at. That gives him a R R hard-on immediately on thespot. That dark corner where the I                   A  seam of her skirt stops his eyes.
 But the rectangular piece of A        N  G   U L flesh he can see becomes like
 a screen on which the                                    images are reflected
 quite vividly. He sees                                   faces thereevenhis own
 face. He sees the face of                                his mother. Also the
 face ofhis father. But                                   notUncle David’s face.
 That would really be indecent. It’s as though he could almost touch that screen so real and so palpable it appears. He even sees a little house there. And lots of trees. Lots ofvegetation. But can one really remember the touch of flesh under such conditions? I suppose. One can always invent alitde. Particularly ifit’s not possible to remember. Or else one can simply approximate how it feels. For instance: Flesh is like a banana peel
           Flesh is like a piece of white paper Flesh is like a dozen eggs in a basket Flesh is like a glass of wine at night
Ac chat point Uncle David folds his newspaper. Dammit! Don’t tell me the subway scene is over and they are getting off already even before all those images are finished. No! Hesetdes back in his seat. And this timehe really goes to sleep. Boris can see that from where he’s sitting but he has to looksideways. Then the subway stops. The man in front of the girl’s face leaves. No! He simply gets a seat wheresomebody else just left to get off. Afatwoman. Those damn subways! They gp on and on. But we must admit that we’ve done some of our best thinking in subways. Solet’s go on. Anyway theguy is not important. He’s gone now. Gone ou t ofscene. The view is clear. Boris looks at the girl. She’s definitely smiling!
            What a smile real or imagined can do for a guy but not everybody has the courage to look peoplestraight in the face takes a huge effort and Boris is so shy he can only look at the girl sideways butshelooks athim square in the face as though she understood that he was all worked upoverherlittle black triangle butshe does not know that this is his first day in America even though she may have a slight suspicion that he’s a foreigner because ofhis suit and also the way his hair is combed and instinctively she moves her legs but does not cross them as one would expect she simply moves a little on her behind shifting her weight from onecheek to the other and as a result the triangle disappears but now Boris sees a different figure much more interesting a rectangle no it’s more like a parallelogram upside down no it’s worse than that what he sees now are two shapeless flabby pieces offleshwithaverydarklineinthemiddlefiguratively it looks like some kind of furry animal and it scares the hell out of him however he can feel his dick throbbing inside his pants against his left thigh he carries left most of the time and that reassures him but nonetheless he says to himself I can’t go on like this and I agree with him I can’t go on either we must find away out of this 365 days like this or we’ll go crazy for sure even though the room idea is a good one the suitcase that’s another matter it’s too obvious too cheap but in any case assuming we have spent $574.91 so far that’s not counting the cigarettes then definitely it’s time to get going with the cigarettes or else we’ll run out of time ofplace money ideas patience goodwill determination breath
And now: Cigarettes
Right now about a pack a day!
A pack and a half a day or so
maybe more — nobody ever keeps track that closely — but under
                                     pressure could be two packs— I should cut down seriously! With all those stories going around about cancer —
cancer of the throat of the breast of the chest of the belly
           of the penis — All that jazz about guys dying around forty or forty-two in the prime of life — it’s a myth — a lie — a joke — of course mere propaganda — cheap publicity!
And suppose you quit then you get fat you get nervous you get normal but you die anyway when your time comes—cigarettes or no cigarettes
—  inevitably —
           Mortality from, cancer of the stomach is five times higher in Japan than the U.S. but American women have seven times as much cancer of the breast as                    Japanese women
as quotedfxomiiieRujfaloEveningNeivs of all places—verbatim
The question then can be asked why?
Because they are flat chested Japanese women that is a wise guy wouldsay ironically but withoutseriouslyconsideringthe consequences ofhis words —
And yet — cancer research is discovering a growing number of these puzzles —
Describing the problems faced by the investigators one doctor paraphrased Winston Churchill’s famous phrase about the Soviet Union..; We are finding a whole lot of riddles wrapped in mysteries inside of enigmas
   This is not invented but merely quoted - these are real facts
   - facts which can be found in every newspaper everyday of your life - but that doesn’t prevent a guy from smoking a pack or a pack and a half of cigarettes a day particularly when working under pressure when locked up in a room for 365 days to spit out his life on paper as he eats noodles everyday and counts horses on the walls all day
  Therefore let us say two packs a day under pressure it’s not too much in this case particularly if you put in 16 or 17 hours a day at the typewriter however for the time being we’ll figure on one and a half pack a day we’ll assume everything is normal everything is as usual and we’ll forget about the pressure then we can agree on a pack and a half a day which means 365 packs plus half of 365 for the year 365 divided by 2 makes 182 point 5 however since you cannot really buy half a pack it’ll have to be 182 even or else 183 we’ll take 183 because it gives us 20 extra cigarettes in case of emergency thus 365 plus 182 makes 548
548 packs of cigarettes for the year—that makes quite a room full — indeed —full of cigarettes and full of smoke!
Now I have the noodles on one wall and now I’ll have the cigarettes on another wall — of course some of the horses will have to be sacrificed —but thatnegates the idea of a square tower of noodle boxes in the middle of the room which was a much more sensible idea — and much more attractive—than piling everything against the wall and thus obstructing from view the flying horses
                            But that’s the danger of cigarrettes!

Quelques reflexions sur le roman aujourd’ hui
original text
   Peut-on dire qu’en denonpant l’imposture d’un roman qui tend a totaliserl’existence etmanque sa“pluridimensionnalit4,’Toeuvre critique nous libere de l’illusion realiste? Je crois plutot qu’elle nous y enferme. Car l’objectif reste le m§me: il s’agit toujours d’exprimer, de traduire quelque chose qui est deja la — meme si etre deja la, dans cette nouvelle perspective, consiste paradoxalement a ne pas etre la. Autrement dit, le roman, en un sens, ne peut pas echapper au realisme. Cette hypotheque pese sur lui depuis l’origine, depuis l’epoque ou pour se justifier du soupfon de frivolite, il a du se presenter comme un moyen de connaissance — et non pas seulement depuis le XDC siecle. LTiistoire du roman n’est [il faut l’admettre] rien d’autre que la succession de ses efforts pour “appresenter” une realite qui toujours se derobe, pour substituter a des miroirs trop grossiers des miroirs plus fins, plus s61ectifs. Mais, en un autre sens, le roman n’ajamais cesse de denoncer, par sarealite meme l’illusion quil’anime. Tousles grands romans sontdesromans critiques qui sous couleur de raconter une hisfcoire, de faire vivre des personnages, d’interpreter des situations, glissent sous nos yeux le mirage tangible d’une forme. Toute oeuvre romanesque forme bloc: on ne peut y soustraire ou y changer un mot, la prolonger ou la devier de son cours. C’est ce qui fait d’elle un leurre. Nous croyons y trouver l’expression de notre unite, alors qu’elle n’en manifestequele desir. Nous croyons, ennousracontant, decrouvrir ce quelqu’un que nous sommes deja. Mais ce quelqu’un n’existe que dans 1'oeuvTe, il en est le produit et non pas la source. Et ceci parce que le propre d’un discours litteraire — c’est-a-dire d’un discours fixe une fois pour toutes — est de trouver sa reference, ses regies d’organisationenlui-meme,etnonpas dansl’exp&ience reelle ou imaginaire sur laquelle il s'appuie. A travers tous les detours qu’on voudra, le sujet qui eerit ne se saisira jamais dans le roman: il ne saisira que le roman, qui par definition, l’exclut
  Some reflections on the novel in our time
                                                         translation
   Ganitbe said that by denouncing the fraudulence ofa novel which tends to totalize existence and misses its multidimensionality, the critical work frees us from the illusion of realism? I rather believe that it encloses us in it. Because the goal remains the same: itis always a question of expressing, oftranslafdngsomething which is already there — even if to be already there, in this new perspective, consists paradoxically in not being there. In other words, the novel, in a sense, cannot escape realism. Thismortgage weighs upon it since its origin, since the period whenfor justifying itself of the suspicion offrivolity, ithad topresentitselfas ameans of knowledge—and not only since the 19th century. The history of the novel is — one must admit it — nothing else but the succession of its efforts to “appresent” a reality which always evades, always substitutesforvulgarmirrorsfinermirrors, more selective mirrors. But, in another sense, the novel is nothing else but a denunciation, by its very reality, of the illusion which animates it. All great novels are critical novels, which, under the pretense of telling a story, of bringing characters to life, of interpreting situations, slide under our eyes the mirage of a tangible form. All fictitious work forms a block: nothing can be taken away from it nor can a single word be changed. That is what makes of the novel a lure. We think we are going to find in it the expression of our unity, whereas in fact it only manifests the desire of it We believe, as we are relating ourself, that we are going to discover, to find, that being that we are already. But that being, that somebody, exists in the work only, it is the product of it and not the source. And this because the essence of a literary discourse — that is to say a discourse fixed once and for all — is to find its own point of reference, its own rules of organization in itself, and not in the real or imaginary experience, on which it rests. Through all the detours that one wishes, the subject who i p. writes will never seize himself in the novel: he will only seize the novel which, by definition, excludes him.......................

Day by Day
Pack by Pack — that’s the story of my life — but in the long run you do save — at least that’s what people tell you if you buy cigarettes by the carton — even if they dry up after a while — a dime here and there adds up in the end — but how the hell am I going to get things going — today — tomorrow morning
—  yesterday he arrived in New York — that’s settled now — but now I’ve got to have a plan of action — a direction — a plot
                                                        Day by Day
55 cartons of cigarettes —                          —  Pack by Pack
Right now you pay about 40 cents a pack — 42 to be exact — Pack by Pack cheaper by the carton — no doubt about that — $3.80 a carton—plus tax it never comes out even — they always confuse you with pennies — always — Let’s say $3.86 even — 55 times 3.86 — takes almost a genius to work this one out — or at least some experience in arithmetic — comes out to 212.30 — just for cigarettes — that’s even more than for the noodles —
                                                         Box by Box
212.30 for smoke puffs —                             —  Day by  Day
Unbelievable — if I give up smoking I can literally double up on the noodles — 105.85 time 2 makes 211.70 — a difference of 60 cents
—  really something — it’s really something to consider — you give up smoking and you have a double portion of noodles each day — except the last two days because of the 60 cents difference—29 cents a box — that’s just about two boxes short — but can I do it — can I give up — is it worth it even to think about it — you get fat — you get nervous — you start eating more — you have a need for sweets
—  then I could perhaps buy a stock of candies — candies instead of the double portion of noodles in one pot — it’s something to consider—I quit smoking—I could do it and manage to have a ball
—  perhaps even a little piece of meat every other day and cookies too — instead of candies — so many possibilities — canned meat of course — what a guy could do with an extra $212.30—it’s incredible
Without cigarettes you’ll go crazy for sure, you’ll get fat, nervous, and paranoiac. No. You’ve got to hang on. Cigarettes are essential, almost as essential as noodles. Unless you give up the whole idea and look immediately for a job. And of course you stop smoking at the same time. Just think, for a moment, what a guy could save rightfrom the start. $212.30 for cigarettes, plus $105.85 for noodles, plus all the rest. Enough to open a nice little savings account in the Bank Trust of America. And also a job on top of that. Security. Normalcy. Regular meals, three times a day, withmeat twice a day. It means you have close to 1100 bucks in the bank. Well a little less because either way I’ll keep the room. A person must have a place to sleep. A place to hang his coat and put his clothes away and put his feet up. And who knows, even a little piece of ass occasionally. Then if I deduct 416 immediately, I still have enough left yes to open my little savings account. But 8 bucks a week for a room, what a crummy room it’ll be. With a job and a little savings account and regular meals, I should be able to afford a 10 dollar a week room in a nice neighborhood. That’s only 520 bucks for the year. With a lovely view looking out on the street. The 10th floor. It’s higher. More freshness more air. 520 for the room, and all the rest in the bank. And work every day from 8 to 5 with half an hour for lunch. Cocksuckers! They always do it to you. Always twisting your mind. Always tempting you with an illusion or a dream. A savings account, and a nice room for 10 bucks a week. They always manage to have you think the way they want you to think. How lucky you caught yourself on time. No — definitely — no .1 won’t give up. I refuse. Object. Protest. Revolt.        F          .lean hear their
little voice whispering in my           U          ears. You could
doitslowly. In the evening after        C          work. And also
on weekends. You could get a YOU K ALL job as a waiter or as a typist. You're a good typist. A taxi-cab driver a travelling $!flesman. You could teach French in high school. Get a college degree with a megor in business administration. In mathematics. Yes with your experience with numbers, lists, additions, subtractions,
lies                                                           lies.
Eventually Boris goes to college andgets a degree. He majors inFrench of course. You’ve got to exploit his natural talent. But this part about his college life does not come into this part of the story. Ithappens much later. After he comes out of the Army. Still I could start asking a few questions about Boris. A few practical questions about his life. About his past. Abouthis present. About his future. All sorts of questions. And when you have the answers then a good part of the story falls in place and is already written. In other words questions always precede answers. And the answers become the writing itself. First you have a question and then an answer. It’s part of what is called the creative process. But it could be the other way around. However that would be very unnatural. You cannot write a story by simply asking questions. Normallyastory is made up of answers. Answers to questions. Only the answers. Questions remain understood. Unformulated verbally or manually. In other words when you read a story what you are really reading are the answers to unformulated questions. So all that crap about fiction writing it’s for the birds. Only traditional and bad fiction writers do it that way usually. The normal way. The real sensitive imaginative inventive progressive guys do it differently. Or at least they try even if they fail in the end. It’s only a matter of patience and determination in any case
Yet it does not prevent some people from writing a statement such as the one that follows: “It has long been a platitude to assert that the nineteenth century was the golden age of fiction supposedly because this fiction portrayed the middle class and because its audience was chiefly recruited from the same middle class.” And to go on with even worse stuff
That's the sort of thing people write about fiction. But nobody ever tries to find out the questions. The original questions unformulated on paper and yet understood in the writer’s mind. The reader doesn’t know that. He only sees the answers. A good reader however tries to find out or at least imagine what the original questions were. But that takes an enormous intellectual effort And not all readers are willing or capable of such an intellectual effort. Therefore it is preferable if the writer wants to be inventive modem progressive and experimental to try a more forward method. That is to say to work backward. To give the questions as the substance of his fiction rather than give the answers. Everybody has answers but few people have real honest sensitive and coherent questions to ask. If the questions are given first on paper then the reader canformulate the answers inhis mind. This does not always
work of course. Because most questions cannot be answered. Then everybody is confused. I know something about that. Being guilty myself of having made such statements at one time or another. Statements which resemble answers but which in fact were not really answers but very bad questions
For instance that kind of statement: “Most works of fiction achieve coherence through a logical accumulation of facts about specific situations and more or less credible characters. In the process of recording or gradually revealing mental and physical experiences organized in an aesthetic or ethical form these works progress toward a definite clear goal: The discovery ofknowledge." More or less. Then there’s little hope for him--------------------------------or--------------------------me
There is indeed little hope for me or for him and yet this does not prevent me from asking him some questions practical questions about himself even though there might not be any discovery ofknowledge and the answers might be totally false therefore let us start with a list of the most basic questions to which we shall give very basic answers to the best of our knowledge so as not to interfere with him in order that he may remain independent and totally candid in his answers thus giving him a chance to shape his own destiny as much as possible even though eventually the course of his destiny might not follow its prescribed course according to the answers he will give to our questions:
Q. - Boris! Where were you bom?
A. - Paris. France.
Q. - Date of birth? That’s a tricky question. Invent here. Literally. In order
              that the dates come out exactly as planned.
              Whoever reads that can calculate from that because if 1 am more specific than that then the whole story becomes dated. "Whoever is reading that can add up himself. If Boris is 19 when he arrives in America and he was bom in 1928 then 1928plus 19 that brings him to America in 1947. That should work. Though it’s always possible to
A.- 1928.
                                                                                            change the dates to render the story more contemporary. Of course one must be careful because of the war. The Jews. The camps. The farm. Nothing too specific of course. Just enough for people to feel sorry for him.
                                                            Q. - 1928? Are you sure?
                                                            A, - What do you mean am I sure? Of course I’m sure. I know exactly when I was born.
                                                            Q. - Ok! Let us not argue. We’ll have enough problems together for the next 365 days damn you! without getting all excited about dates. And in any case this is not a question.
            A. - After the war.
                                                             Q. - Which war?
                                                             A. - What do you mean which war? The big one of course!
                                                             Q.- What kind of an answer is that? The big one! Either you say the First World War or the Second World War. But you cannot say the Big One. Doesn’t make sense.
                                                             A. - Ok! The Second World War. After the Liberation. All that in French of course. The answers being translated simultaneously.
                                                             Q. - How long have you been in this country?
                                                             A. - You’re kidding! You too. The eternal question.
          Q. - When did you come to America?
                                                                  Q. - Ok! Skip that one.
                                                              Q. - How do you like it here?
A. - Unbelievable! I refuse to answer that one too.
Q. - Ok! I apologize,.. Let’s try something else.,. Why did you come?
A. - You see I could have gone to Africa with my aunt in Dakar who owns a beautiful huge hotel and I would have worked with her in her big hotel but my uncle from America wrote to me m English after the war asking if I wanted to come to America and start a new life it was a difficult decision but meanwhile my aunt from Africa — Aunt Rachel — came to see me in Paris by plane and bought me a watch a beautiful wrist watch—in fact my first wrist watch and she also wanted me to come to Dakar with her and she said to me that of course the climate there is very hot but that I would get used to it.
Q. - Please! Skip the details. Be specific. And besides that doesn’t answer the basic question why did you come to America? You ask
      a guy a very basic question and there he goes telling you his whole life story. Helps when you’re stuck. But it's beside the point. But it isn’t it true of all stories? Who knows what the right answer is. Who knows if the answers the reader reads are really the correct answers to the questions. The original unformulated questions. And assuming I make him 19 when he arrives in America, and he answers 1928 to the question date of birth then the whole story is immediatement d£pa$s4e et dat4e. Sometimes it’s better not to ask questions at all. However if he is bom the same year as I was bom —1928 — then the story must take place in the past — unless it’s a coincidence — in order that the two of us may not be the same person. If however we decide to make the story more contemporary then we will have to change his birtkdate. He could be bom in 1948for instance. But that means that we have to skip the War the Jews the Farm the Camps entirely because he would not yet have been born when it all happened. That fucks up the whole story. No it’s preferable! I mean it’s better to lie a little about dates and about his past. Or else throw the whole story into the past tense. The near past. Or better yet into a
^ fictitious past. But that creates another problem. The problem of time. The time
      element is always there yes always there to bug you. I’ll have another chance to deal with it later I’m sure. But for the time being let us goon with a few more questions just to see what happens and how we get out of them.
Q. - Is your family still in France?
A. - No!
Q. - Where are they?
A. - Dead.
Q. - That's sad. But can you be a bit more specific?
A. - You see they were deported my father my mother and my two sisters but usually I don’t mention my two sisters because then people think you are exaggerating by the Germans to a concentration camp I think it was Auschwitz and they never
     returnednodoubthavingbeenexterminated deliberately X*X*X*X
     we were Jewish and eventually they became lampshades and this is why after the war when my uncle... .and also my aunt from Africa it was a difficult decision because____
Q. - Please! That’s enough. Don’t get carried away.
Q. - What did your father do?
A. - What do you mean? What did my father do?
Q. - Yes. How did he make a living?
A. - Oh!Notverywell.Hewasanartist.AsuxTealistpainter.Notabad painter. I could write a whole book about my father. But that does not necessarily mean that what I would write would be about my real father. On the contrary. Everybody invents an image of his father. A legendary father. A mythical father image. A dream father. And when it comes to my father. What a myth my father.
Q. - Wellsaidbutnobodyisaskingyoutogetcarriedaway.Bespecific. Just mention the essential. For instance his physical attributes.
A. - Tall. Dark. Blue grey eyes. Jewish. And also quite a gambler when he had nothing else to do.
Q. - Was he faithful to your mother?
 A. - That I really don’t know. I doubt it.
 Q. - All fathers are alike. I could also write quite a story myself about ray father. Everybody invents a perfect image of one’s father. Nothing more deceptive more false more intriguing than your father and I don’t mean your real father. Mothers are different. Mothers usually don’t have to be reinvented because they remain real. Even after they are gone. With some exceptions of course. My mother! But who the hell cares about my mother?
 Q. - What about your mother? Who was she? What did she do? How did she look?
 A. - I prefer not to answer all these questions. I prefer to keep mother my mother the way she was. The way I remember her. With her dark eyes full of sadness.
 But finally all these questions lead nowhere - because in the end all you get is false answers - and yet could help to have a list of questions - very short and precise questions - but questions only - nothing more or nothing else * no answers - something like a questionnaire - or like an
 inquisition: N ame?
              A ge?
              P lace of B irth?
              N ame of F ather and P rofession?
              N ame of M other and P rofession?
              N umber of S isters and A ge?
              N umber of B rothers if A ny?
 of course it will be a bit too sketchy - one may have to be much more
 - specific - much more - personal - to get anywhere - definitely - one ♦bould cut down - or else give up completely - particularly now - with all those stories going around about cancer • some people don’t take it seriously - but every day they come out with more reports more
 warnings more statistics more convincing evidence - and another guy dies - mouth cancer - lung cancer - even though he has been warned - told & retold
                     Caution: cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health may smoking cigarette be : Caution
but they insist on the may - and another guy dies anyway - and soon you no longer may - it's frightening I but thenif you give up - you must face the certainty of getting fat -fat like a pig - and nervous too - like a rat - scares the shit out of me - and what happens ? you die anyway
- it never fails - you die of apoplexy - or a heart attack - of anything
- and in the end it comes out the same - also they claim - without any evidence - that if you stop smoking you start eating like a pig - twice as much as before - imagine - in my condition - imagine - in my situation - it would be a disaster -1 mean once I am working in the room - on noodles - two boxes a day instead of one - though in the long run it would be cheaper - noodles are cheaper per box than packs of cigarettes - that’s a fact - as we have already witnessed - not by much but a penny here and there could help in the end - unquestionably!
or Cigarettes

Therefore the list of questions previously asked about Boris is not a bad idea at all because it gives me a beginning
                                a starting point
                                a way to keep going and of course to g myself out of that stupid idiotic comer                                  e
                                     I  got into quite inadvertantly     t
.............................................quite accidentally
                                                                        t
That’s the way to go then more questions but nothing                     h
too deep nothing too personal about his family or else                   e
it gets full of cheap psychological crap and poor Boris gets all sorts ofbad complexes but with a list of questions once you are h
inside the room you canget goingrightoffthe batand not waste days        e
and days and boxes just to write that crucial first paragraph and we     1
know how it can be crucial that first paragraph how crucial it can be    1
at the very least the first few days therefore in the beginning all I do you might say is answer the questions about Boris but the big            o
questionsr emain the big questions as to whether or notl should write    u
the list of questions now or wait until I am locked up in an impossible  t

                                                                  of course I
could also do the same for the scenes that is to say make a list of all the scenes in the story and the same thing for all the themes because you have to have                                         themes        ot evah
                                                                  have in a good story
otherwise the whole story falls apart                   a            story
without themes is like a chicken without feathers therefore here are some possible themes:
                          loneliness that’s normal feeling of desertion that’s not unusual suicidal tendencies everybody has some search for love    that’s quite common
sexual voracity    that’s not a theme that’s
......an obsession..........
Obsessions of course should also be listed even though it may put you into an
R E N R O C rehto
 A story should be like a huge gigantic enormous questionaryjuH ofobsessionsand of course this immediately suggests the concept ofa quest even though the concept of a quest is an old-fashioned concept nevertheless the hero or ifyou prefer the protagonist while quesdng for himself asks questions about himself about his life about life in general about the past at least the near past the future the present the conditional but instead of answering these question he allows the story to give the answers or so it seems but in fact it is the creator of the story the inventor ifyou prefer who gives the answers and of course beyond that if there is a recorder for the story then that recorder faithfully waits in the hollow of his fate to see what is going to happen to him which means that whoever invents the story must be in a position to know all the answers or else everything falls apart and that is an almost unbearable situation
 Indeed it is a preposterous situation for a guy to be in therefore the best thing for him to do is to give up immediately drop the whole story and in this case since you arc the inventor that is to say me since I am the answerer of all the questions or ifyou prefer the manipulator of all the answers then the best thing for me to do is to give up immediately this minute and drop the whole stupid idiotic scheme in which I got myself all wrapped up from the moment I started considering quite seriously first the price of a room per week in which to lock myself and second the amount of noodles I would need in the room and the price per box in order to survive and write the damn story and beyond that all the other stuff which eventually led me straight into that unbelievable comer thatidioticpredicamentthatstupidsituationofhaving to choose between a double portion of noodles per day at the expense of giving up smoking totally and the danger of growing fat like a pig fat and nervous and very confused
 And for what yes for what I ask you so that everything can fit into place in this preposterous real fictitious discourse now in progress and which has occupied us for days and days hours and hours and possibly will still occupy us for mon ths and mon ths but no more than 365 days page after page box after box until the end or at least until we run out of things to say but even that is doubtful for the discourse must go on for quite a while still considering that we have already gone quite far without having yet said half or even one third of all that we originally wanted to say when we started saying what we wanted to say at the beginning and it all began remember with a very simple straight-forwardstatementwhich was immediately recorded by the recorderwhile the protagonist waited in the hollow of his fate to see what would happen to him eventually when he would arrive in America by boat from France meet his uncle on the pier and go by subway to the Bronx to visit a Jewish family and so on but in fact what did really happen that is the important question what really happened?
   Nothing! Nothingm uch really. Boris hardly got offthe boat yet. Let’s assume then that Boris is still on the boat. Boris! I’m not convinced yet that Bob or Samuel might not be better. Or something more real. More French. More
 human. Dominique perhaps! In any case he’s still on the boat. Ahead of him like a huge hole an enormous hollow sphere lies the future. A kind of void. Emptiness. America. The hollow of his fate. His future in America still unrealized. Of course his imagination or mine working for his fills the void with all sorts of notions. Dreams. Daydreams. Anticipations. Apprehensions. Wishes. Memories. Crap. Souvenirs. Possibilities. Illusions. And any other such notions that come to his mind. And of course the void symbolizes America. The American way of life. And since he does not know a thing about America except for what he has seen in American movies it’s easy to invent or imagine. But movies always distort reality. The void of America in black-and-white. Or in color. In technicolor. That’s the feeling an immigrant should have about America when he first arrives. And then life in America consists offilling up the void. Though this is true not only of immigrants but of everybody in America. I may be exaggerating a bit but in general that’s about it. In general terms.
       So OKJl get in the room about nine in the morning and I start writing. My noodles are piled up against the wall. But not too close to the wall so I can walk behind to count my horses. Or better yet in the center of the room in a kind of huge square tower of boxes. But the cigarettes are against the wall. 55 cartons. My shit paper too. My toothpaste. My reserve toothbrush. My tomato sauce for extra flavor. My coffee sugar sal t. Everything in other words. And now I’m ready to go.
                 And now what do I do? I start inventing a few things. Things should come quite quickly at first. It’s the rewriting that’s difficult. It’s always the rewriting that eats up time. Noodles too. At this point it’s just a matter of patience and determination. A matter of waiting until tomorrow morning. Sounds simple enough. Who ever thought of that before? Nobody! Nobody that I know. But of course I’ve got to have all the stuff ready. On time to get started. That might be a stumbling block. So many stumbling blocks in the world. One more. One less. The important thing is to keep fighting. Crawling. Sweating. Jumping if necessary. Up & Down. But never Ming.
                                                                                   The theme
 of the young immigrant is not unusual. Boris. Dominique. I like Boris better. Dominiqueis a bit effeminate. But try it out for awhile. You can always go back ^p.Boris if necessary. He doesn’t realize that on the boat he has already begun to become an immigrant. The moment he sets foot on the boat. For most guys it’s just a journey. Atrip. For him it’s the beginning ofa way oflife. But just the beginning. Particularly since he has no idea what he’s going to do in America. He doesn’t even know his uncle. At first he thinks of it as just another trip. A
way to get away from France and all the misery. He had endured so much since his parents and two sisters were shipped to the concentration camp to be exterminated. And alsosince theend of the war. Nojob and no money of course. Not a single real friend. No family. All dead. It is really tough to live like that. Not even a father to tell you about life or at least about the facts of life. Not even a spiritual father. That’s really sad.
                                                                  One of the
faces he sees quite vividly in the little black triangle between the girl's legs in the subway is his father's face. Can't tell from where he's sitting if it's his real father or if it's only the face of his legendary invented father. The mythical father he started making upafter the war. That's exactly what he begins to realize while stating between the legs. Here I am he's thinking in America. Feels strange. Feels like lam really all alone. Astranger. A foreigner in my double-breasted suit That's the style at the timeheleaves France but it's not necessarily the style when he arrives in America. Long lapels. Double-breasted with tiny stripes. A few days later after you've crossed the ocean you'reoutofstyleand thereisnothingyoucan doaboutit Particularly at that time of the year when it's so hot and you can't afford to buy a new suit
    Must be July or August Hot like hell. Most men in the subway in shirt sleeves. Except for a few guys fanatics who wear light suits and ties andstraw hats. Those funny straw hats really make you feel like a foreigner particularly thecolorfulhat bands around them. Funny! The truth is you only begin to feel likeaforeignerin a foreign country in contrast with otherpeople. The natives. And particularly when these natives make you feel like a foreigner just the way they dress or the way they stand sometimes. The way they speak of course. Or the way they cut their hair. The way they eat also. Particularly theway they cut their meat Constantly changing theknifeand the fork from the left to the right hand and back to the left and then back again. It's really confusing. It's discouraging. Particularly fora guy who does not change hands when he cuts his meat Tobe a foreigner in a foreign land is an excruciating experience. They standin front of you the natives in their light suits and straw hats and suddenly you feel like hell in your outmoded heavy double-breasted suit Suddenly you feel ridiculous. And then they start asking you questions about yourself. Particularly the "two eternal questions." And of course there's no way out You start speaking their language and immediately they know you axe a foreigner. Before when you keptyourmouthshuttheyonlysuspectedsomethingbuttheywerenotsure because there was really no way they could tell But there is always doubt in their minds. And since Boris does not speak much in the beginning. Shit! That Boris name keeps coming back he remains in a doubtful condition. That's the problem with talking too much. Eventually you reveal yourself.
But when you don't talk you become a suspiciously suspicious character.
I know that feeling welL Spoke of it before. In:
AMONG                           THE                          BEASTS
Bareass
skin tight to my bones
I swam the ocean
under the water
a long swim yeais ago
As I came up for air
an old man squeezed my shoulders
and I shouted
America America
but there was no answer
The subway was full
and I felt too white
and fat women touched me all over
and I thought it was love
and when I looked up at the sky
                                                          the moon had spread her legs they didn't see me blush in the dark I sneaked out of the window climbed behind a cloud to look for god but all I found there were my footprints Tired of the stars I came back among men in straw hats Had a hot dog and a Lucky and then they shipped me across the Pacific Had myself a few Chinese and again back in my room the light and gas had been turned off but days later I found the bill in my shoe and that's when I began writing poetry without punctuation of course
All that for a dozen crummy straw hats in a subway on a hot summer afternoon. Butwhatan afternoon! First dayinAmerica.How can youforget it? Andyetyou can't even stick with onename. One! Only one. Dominique.
                                                                        Dominique!
Dominique! If you insist Since he won't speak much in the beginning nobodywillreallynoticehe'saforeigner.Exceptforthedouble-breastedsuit and the way he combs his hair. I'll speak for him. But I won't think for him at least not in the beginning. Let him think for himself. He wonders for instance. He wonders a great deal. If the girl whose legs he's looking at is American. Doesn't' show. He feels a bit different knowing that she knows oar suspects that he's not an American, It makes him feel superior. At least that'swhathetellshimself.Whileinhispantsit'sgettinghotlikehell.And stiff. What a romantic idea. The damn bitch keeps moving her knees. But never enough togetagoodlookonceandforalLAndeven if shedidwouldn't make any difference.
                    It's more interesting just to imagine. That's what he keeps telling himself. To feel different gives him mixed feelings of superiority and inferiority. He knows that He would like to be like all the other guys in the subway. Except that most of them are black. That's one thing that really puzzles him. It?s like being in Africa.
Nobody ever told him that. You arrive in New York. You take the subway. And it's like being in Africa or at least in some kind of exotic country. That’s what I mean about movies they really distort reality. An immigrant onhis way to America doesn’t really know that there are so many black people in America. How would he know? Not by seeing cowboy movies or gangster movies. That’s for sure.
                                                  Naturally he won’t
be folly aware of being an immigrant until he arrives in Detroit. And on top of that a J ewish immigrant from France. That's essential for the story. The search for an identity. A young man about 19. All alone. A Frenchman. A Jew. A lonely-young-Jewish-French-immigrant that’s what he is. Five basic elements in one person: loneliness, youth, race nationality, and status. How the hell do you find your identity with a background as complex as that? How do you establish relationships with others? How do you relate with others? These are difficult questions!
          But before I forget make a list of all the people he meets during his first five years in America. Not only his friends but also all those people he considers his friends. In chronological order but not necessarily in alphabetical order. Simply in chronological order of encounter and of course first names only:
Joseph. Ernest. Richard. Frank. Roselyn. Dick. Robert. Solomon. Loulou. George. Jacques. Tommy. Bernice. Jane. Michael. Erskine. Gloria. Pierre. Charles. Peggy. Gugusse. John. Donald. Christy.
And so many others forgotten. Not all of them real friends though. Some of them just people he met. And of course a few special ones you just can’t mention here it would be too indiscreet.
                                                 And just as he was
thinking of possible names for all the people he would eventually meet during his first few years in America the girl with the legs gets up from her seat to get off the subway. Must be around 179th Street. He keeps staring at her. She is now standing in front of the sliding doors waiting for the subway to stop and for the doors to slide open. He has to turn his head slightly to the right. Uncle David is sitting on his left. Doesn't mattermuchwhichsidebutitmakesitmore credible. She’stall and her dress is very tight around her hips. And what an a s s! Her ass is particularly striking. Enormous. Round and high on her legs. Unusual to look at for a foreigner. Quite an unusual monument if you put this one among all the other monuments he saw duringhis sightseeing tour of New York City with his uncle. French asses are not that big and not
that round. In fact French asses are always too low and often too flabby. But this is only a conjecture on the part of our protagonist because he has not really touched that many asses in his life. Remember he’s only 19. And extremely shy. But neverthelesshe takes a good look at this one. It looks almost as if it had been raised deliberately. Never has he seen a woman shaped like this one and when it comes to looking at women our protagonist takes full advantage of it. He almost feels like getting up and dropping everything. Uncle David. America. Loneliness. Jewishness. And all the rest. He just feels like walking out Or just simply walking over to the girl to squeeze her ass. And then he would follow her. From behind. Just to see what would happen. Just like that. Poor Uncle David if only he knew what was going on in his nephew’s mind on his first day of confrontation with America. But that would be a tremendous way for him to discover America. Walk around the streets alone following a girl with an enormous ass. A black girl on top of that. Ayoungbeautiful black American girl. That’s five basic elements in one person: youth, beauty, race or color, nationality, sex. Just as he was reflectingon these basic elements Uncle David moves a little in his seat. Coughs a little. But immediately seems to go back to sleep. Just when the subway stops. Of course when Uncle David moves Dominique looks away from the girl. Just a few seconds. The door opens. She’s still standing there. Just a few seconds as if she were deciding whether or not she’s going to get off or stay. No kidding. She is looking straight at him now. No time to fuck around with lists of names themes and all those basic elements. No time to debate personality and character and relationship. He’s got to make up his mind quick. He catches sight ofhis suitcase between his legs. He feels like crying suddenly. His hard on disappears like a deflated balloon. But he can’t get up. Can’t follow her.
 T... oo... too many problems... too many stumbling blocks... whatdoes a guy do in a situation like this...?... the suitcase... Uncle David... first day in America... the noodles... the room... the subway... that's how it goes... Suddenly you realize where you are... in the subway... in America... on the way who knows where... he doesn’t know because when Uncle David told him where they were going he didn’t understand a damn thing... C’est normal... finally when the door opens and the girl steps down he knows it’s too late... just lost his first friend in ^mericA... sometimes a look a good look is enough to make a friend... the sliding door slams shut... he turns his head all the way around making believe that he’s looking at the name of the station to know where he is... and the sub starts moving... it moves past the girl... she is walking in the same direction as the sub... towards the exit
I suppose... but of course not as fast as the train... C’est normal... or at first... I mean... when the train just starts moving... she walks almost as fast as the train... meaning that her face is even or almost even with the window where Dominique is sitting and they are almost face to face across the window-pane... but they cannot talk to each other because of the loud noise. ..shit... those descriptions are difficult... he sees her face on the other side of the window... she is beautiful for a black girl he thinks... but of course he has no idea what black beauty is... he has really no real criteria to judge... all this is new to him... he's seen girls before... girls from AfricA... but never really payed much attention to them... this one is different... unforgettable... beautifully unforgettable. .. and American on top of that... she smiles at him... yes... he’s sure of that... just as she vanishes behind the train... but what a smile... thick red lips half opened and you can see her white teeth and then a little pointed tip of her tongue... that much he saw... he smiles back... but too late... but here he goes again... his pants bulging again... but he keeps his hands over it on his lap... and then it’s finished... the train plunges into the tunnel... into the darkness.into the big belly of AmericA... she’s gone... and her little black triangle
too he’ll never see her again... unless there is a huge coincidence...
an accident... and he sees her again accidentally... but for now it? s the end of the subway scene..................................................
Conventionally a guy would treat something like that with an appropriate vocabulary: quickening pulse, bulging eyes, cold sweat, hot flashes, trembling hands, muted gases, strangled cries, copious sighs. But certainly not in a situation like this one. Because feats of annihilation and even feats of creation ought to be harder than they look. Even in the worse moments of isolation the pulse of humanity goes on ticking in an orderly and hopeful manner. Then there is no use wasting a single moment on that kind of emotionalism. Even if Dominique or anybody else in his place feels he’s just missed the chance of his lifetime. There are so many missed chances in one’s lifetime. One more or less. It’s hopeless!
Dominique often thinks about that girl during his first few weeks in America keeps him going it’s like a beautiful image in his mind in the back of his mind and in fact the first few times he masturbates in America it’s with the image of that girl in front of his eyes that he does it especially the legs slightly spread apart and the little black triangle in the middle but eventually he does it with other images other legs other triangles other asses but the one image that sticks to his mind the mostistheimageofthatgirlandthat’s the imagehe uses themostoften in the beginning it’s self-explanatory in fact as the subway roars through the tunnel he suddenly imagines himself walking behind the girl in the street but the street is very vague it’s hard to imagine streets that you have never seen before and he has no idea how it is around 179th Street so he imagines it more like Boulevard des Italiens that’s the problem with guys in that kind of a situation they imagine everything the wrong way by associations or simply by transposing one place into another place or a past time into a present time                                                it’s a good past
time                                                But he follows
her anyway eventhough he doesn’t know where he’s going or what kind of a girl she is and he sees himself in his mind walking a few steps behind her all nervous and anxious waiting to see what will happen next what a walk! she turns around once just as they emerge from the subway so she knows now he’s there behind her and it’s possible that she suspects that he’s following her but at the same time she might not suspect anything lots of guys get off at 179th Street could be a coincidence and perhaps he also happens to live in this part of the city or else he might simply be visiting some friends in the neighborhood too bad she doesn’t know him and never met him before because he’s a good looking young man a little shy it’s true it shows and somewhat strange in his funny outmoded double-breasted suit and the way he combs his hair he could be a foreigner %■ else a queer or some kind of artist or even an actor eventhough he does look young and inexperienced but one never knows with guys you meet in the subway on a hot summer afternoon in July or August and who look at you with such passionate eyes what a cute kid
   At this point I could get into her mind just to see what she’s thinking, lots of guys do that. I could work it out. everything is possible, normally you’ve got to be consistent but nobody prevents you from stepping in and out of people’s heads, as long as you don’t cheat and tell the truth, word for word and step by step, and of course you clean it up a little because usually people think dirty in their minds, but it would give depth to the story and also it would permit the characters to reveal their inner-selves and everything else that goes on inside of them, of course that creates all sorts of psychological complications which must eventually be resolved one way or another. but we’ll face this one when we come to it. for the time being suffices to say that I have given some thought to the matter and leave it at that, later we will tackle this very problem seriously when we are confronted with it. lets’ say around the 17th or 18thbox down the precipice feet first beard down to my waist the room stinks like hell, alone in my noodle universe moving in and out of people’s minds and bodies, what a mess it will be. what a lovely mess!
Then she seems to be slowing down in fact she stops for a moment in front of a shop window a jewelry store to be exact that's if Dominique is able to imagine a jewelry store on 179th Street he doesn’t know what to do now therefore he too stops in front of a shopwindow a men’s clothing store it’s more logical but he can’t stand there like a jerk forever and since while looking at her shop window she notices that he is looking at her instead of looking at his shopwindow he is now committed and so he walks past her quickly and excitedly feeling his heart pounding inside his chest but he doesn’t dare turn around once he’s past her so he keeps on going with his legs trembling under him and his neck hurting in the back just
from feeling a presence behind him her presence he assumes but it could be somebody else’s presence because there are many people in the street finally he can’t stand it anymore and he quickly turns around just enough to get a quick look once you've committed yourself you have to act fast but behind him he sees a tall skinny guy with a grey hat on who is reading his newspaper while walking and for a moment he thinks he has lost the girl but then he finds her again a little further back in the crowd still walking in the same direction and this time she sees that he sees her what doyou do now ?

Here we are then two weeks later. 17 or 18 days or boxes later. ( working on a stupid incident that never happened, and now we ) are stuck in the middle of the street following a girl who posi- ( tively allows herself to be followed, a girl who might not even ) exist, we’ve got to do something, it’s a street crossing and the ( traffic light is green, do we cross the street? do we turn around? ) do we turn the corner without crossing the street? or do we ( simply stand there like jerks and do nothing? just wait and see ) what will happen right there in the middle of a page, lots of guys ( get stuck like that in the middle of the street or the middle of a ) page, but we just can’t stand there for 365 days or so. lucky it’s ( not raining, what would poor Boris do? he doesn’t have an um- ) brella. and suppose he crosses the street and she turns the cor- ( ner. or suppose he turns the corner and she crosses the street, all ) kinds of possibilities here, he’s fucked, if he crosses the street and ( she turns the corner then he will have to stop on the other side to ) see what she’s doing and then when he sees that she has turned ( he’ll have to cross the street again to catch up or vice versa with ) her. and if the traffic light is red he’ll have to wait and very likely ( lose her in the crowd, forever, that would really be bad. dammit! )
Of course if somebody asks what he's doing
he can always say he’s lost
Happens to anybody to get lost in a strange city
He crosses the street
Stops on the other side and looks up
as if he were looking at the street name
That’s a good excuse
You have to stop and look up to look at a street name Nothing wrong with that
So he just stands there with his nose up in the air And just then she's standing next to him She smiles
A real smile this time
Before nobody was sure she had really smiled
But this time no doubt about it
You’re looking for a street? She says
That should do
She’s almost as tall as he is
And what a lovely voice
If she talks to him like that what do you do next What can he answer
First of all he doesn’t speak a word of English
And second he doesn’t understand what she says
He could show his mouth with his finger
meaning I don’t speak the language
But she might think he’s mute and dumb
He might mumble something
Or else answer in French
To make sure she doesn’t think he’s dumb
He knows two or three words of English
Yes
No
Thank you
He could use them now all at once
Doesn’t matter because before he knows what's happening
she’s holding his arm just like that
Dammit! The fist thing he thinks to himself
C’est une putain in French of course
He doesn’t know the English word for putain
And then he gets scared
                     She’s after my money He has exactly fifty dollars with him Fifty dollars in a black wallet in his back pocket And two 5 franc bills for souvenir She might take him up to her room and a guy might walk in when he’s not looking and hit him on the head And here goes all his money Happens all the time But that’s not what happens She’s not a whore Just a nice working girl At least that’s what he thinks to himself And since he never got off the subway he can imagine anything he wants
                                                          Stupid ass
                If I were in his shoes I wouldn’t hesitate a moment Once you’ve committed yourself you’ve got to go on
          So she’s holding his arm and they start walking together
                 And after a while before he knows what’s happening he is up in her apartment Not a bad place And the door is hardly closed that she grabs him and kisses him hard smack on
                                                          the mouth
                        her red tongue sliding under his shy tongue
                               It’s exciting like hell They didn’t even speak to each other They simply understand each other Just like that
          Sometimes people do understand each other without any
                                             necessity for words Must be her room A bit on the sloppy side messy
                             with clothes all sorts of clothes all over He is a little bit less scared now
What helps is to know that he’s in somebody’s room who cares a little for him just the way the room is messy shows she’s a good person she must be living alone clothes on the floor on the back of chairs on the bed also and jazz records too all over the floor at first he felt like running away but the kiss she gave him gave him some courage and now while she is picking up some of the clothes and shoving them in a closet while apologizing he’s standing in the middle of the room his legs trembling like weeds in the wind under him the excitement the emotion and the anticipation all that together is enough to make a guy tremble and then suddenly she stands behind him with her arms around him her whole body glued to his breathing hard in his neck and kissing him lots of little wet kisses down his neck she must be some kind of sex maniac he thinks but it’s not an unpleasant thought on the contrary behind his ears now the little wet kisses like birds and then her hand the left one slides down along his chest and further down along his belly and then on his fly he can’t stand it much longer particularly when she begins unbuttoning his fly in this story French pants don’t have zippers he’s going to explode in his underwear any moment if she does not stop immediately but suddenly Uncle Arthur no David moves a little in his seat coughs a little and then starts talking to Boris no Dominique in Yiddish it’s all over the subway is slowing down he doesn’t understand a damn thing of what his uncle is saying except that when Uncle David gets up to get off at the next stop he understands that it will be the end of the subway scene and the beginning of the next scene the Jacobsons scene all that is too good to waste and yet it is not that good because it really has nothing to do with the plot as such if there were to be a plot in this story but it doesn’t matter I can always rework it eventually and work it in they are lying on the bed now it’s almost dark I’ll describe the strange smell in the room at least the smell seems strange to Dominique and he’s holding on to her tremendous ass The smell and the ass these are the two things that really struck him at the beginning he’ll never forget that the smell and the the ass and it was the same thing with Ernest’s mother same enormous ass and same strange exotic smell with Ernest’s mother but it was much more real much more of a confrontation and the way it happened so unexpectedly and so easily also he cannot forget it and in fact he thinks about it often afterwards when he no longer lives in Detroit it keeps him going momentarily when he's lonely he must have been in Detroit a good three months already when it happened Peggy incidentally was still writing to him from Milwaukee and they had been rehearsing in the auditorium and by now he could really play the
clarinet well but still it was the saxophone thathe wanted to play they were rehearsing for a few marches for a football game I think or something like that the whole band was there imagine Dominique Boris Dominique doesn’t matter it’s the same guy already playing in the band for football games and he’s been in Detroit only three months or so must have been natural talent and as they came out of the auditorium he asked Ernest where he was going by then his English was quite acceptable I’ve gotta cut man Ernest said he had to cut to go to his job he was working in his Mobil gas station on the East Side every day for five six hours he even worked on Saturdays but not on Sundays Boris had a job in a grocery-delicatessen-type-store but he only started working at five o’clock every afternoon until closing time at ten o’clock and it’s about one o’clock when they come out of the auditorium after rehearsal not that it matters much what time it was and in fact Dominique was not working in the grocery store at that time he was already working at Chrysler the late afternoon shift but this being a Saturday he didn’t have to go to work and usually on Saturday after band rehearsal he goes to swimming practice he’s quite a busy body for a foreigner but Boris is a very active person eventually I’ll put him on the swimming team it's not too preposterous because nothing prevents him from being a good swimmer he specializes in the backstroke even though he’s a French Jewish immigrant lots of guys in that condition are good swimmers he learned during the war while working very hard on the farm while other guys older than him were fighting the war and trying to save the country from the Germans and many of them jerks died while he practiced his swimming up and down that little river behind the farm house usually naked and that’s how eventually he learned that particular stroke called the backstroke he preferred the backstroke because while swimming on his back in his little river up and sown he could look at the sky—Boris has a passion for the clouds and the sky that day however after he left Ernest at his Mobil station he decided to skip swimming even though he knew the coach Mr. Zimmerman would be pissed sorry off because there was an important swim meet the following week between Northern High School’s team the water-vipers against the YMCA team the homosapians but Boris felt ifeat it was much more important that day to go and thank Ernest’s mother for the lovely birthday party she had given him for his first birthday in America everybody thought I am sure that I had forgotten the birthday party and Ernest’s mother’s enormous ass and the way they danced together but not really all this
time there it was in the back ofeverybody’s mind and it was just a matter of finding a way back to it and if you remember we had left Boris panting up the stairs that lead to Ernest’s pad just as he was about to knock on the door! and so almost unconsciously Boris found himself in front of Ernest’s apartment a three story building typical crummy building ready to knock on the door and at this point his mind is bubbling with all sorts of erotic images and he starts talking to himself in the first person as if telling himself the story of what is happening I felt my heart beating like a machine as I heard someone move behind the door inside the apartment the black 48 Buick was not outside where Ernest’s father usually parks it I was certain of that I checked therefore one can assume that he’s not home that proves that Ernest was not lying when he said that his father and his sister had gone to a baseball game I'll simply ask if Ernie is home she says Hi Frenchy come on in Ernie is not home he works today in his gas station didn’t he tell you doesn’t matter sit down I was just going to have myself a little glass of Bourbon want some of course Boris never drinks but this time he’ll make a little exception and before he even has a chance to say a word or to explain that he thought Ernest was home and that he came to borrow some music sheets that's a good excuse he finds himself sitting on the sofa with a glass full of Bourbon in his left hand his right hand sort of resting loosely on a pillow next to him on the sofa almost touching her hand also resting loosely on the same pillow and he didn’t even have time to say too bad I’ll drop in later when Ernest is home and then without even being asked she starts explaining that Ernie’s father and Ernie’s sister have gone to a baseball game the Detroit Tigers against the Senators she thinks with the 48 Buick and suddenly he feels himself growing in his pants it's an obsession with him the living room is clean she must have just finished cleaning she still has her little apron around her waist on top of some kind of thin house dress nothingtoo elegant and barefoot her big black feet sort of funny because her toes are all crooked her hair is a mess also curly all over she’s enormous but good looking for a fat woman of her age if Ernest is about 17 or maybe 18 he’s a senior at most she must be around 37 or 38 or even less of course Boris has no idea how old she is he’s only speculating but she does look like a mother but a sexy mother no question about that the sofa is green and the room very light and then suddenly she disappears into another room the radio is playing a deep voice singing a slow tune a blues with a saxophone in the background makes it romantic sort of sad then she’s back but this time she has taken off her apron and brings more
                                                Bourbon and more ice
                                                          cubes Boris is no drinker in fact he never touches the stuff must emphasize that but he takes another shot and makes believe he loves it he’s just being polite and sociable you might say in a situation like this one you have to and now she’s standing in front of him giggling her legs spread apart lifting her glass to her lips in quickjerky movements the whole scene looks like it
to himself in situations like these. Perhaps not in those terms but close enough.
There are certain terms he never uses. He’s been in the country more than three months now. But still he doesn’t use certain words that easily. His English has improved a great deal. No question about that. And he knows the exactmeaningofwords like fuck you or son of a bitch and even motherfucker but it is not easy for him to use these words.
It’s not natural. In fact if •emetimes he uses one of the wordsmentioned above with his friends in school or in the factory with the
other guys it's strictly accidental or else it’s because he wants to
was rehearsed What the fuck am I doing here? Boris thinks. He always thinks
impress them. But usually the other guys laugh at him as though he was using something very incongruous. Sometimes he even says these words on purpose just to see the reaction. But it’s not natural for him. Takes years before you can say fuck you like an American.
A real American. It’s another thing when it comes to doingit It’s universal. I don’t think we need to go into that No need for it at this point. Right now Boris should simply be getting all excited about Ernest’s mother sitting there next to him on the sofa. But of course he doesn’t know if she really wants to. He only thinks she wants to. That’s always the problem with a guy who wants to screw another guy’s girl or another guy’s wife or another guy’s mother. He never knows if she really wants it. Or if she’s simply playing a game. Infact one never knows until ithappens. And even then the whole thing is more like a dream. It’s true that the time they danced together at the
-  ,                                        ,               birthday party she was rubbing like hell against
                                                             him but that means nothing. Could be natural

                                                   with her. Particularly the way she dances. And fat the way she is. She just can’t avoid rubbing against the guy she dances with. Also that night she was drunk. Could also be Boris’ imagination or mine.
                                                   After all we are coinciding merging into one another more and more as it was expected. Dammit I wish she hadn’t given him such a huge glass of Bourbon. He could get out of there faster. The discjockey is now talking with somebody on the radio and the two guys are laughing. That’s a good touch.
                                                   I'll have to describe that in details. Particularly the roundness. She was really round all over. Her arms.
                                                   Her face. Her legs. Her ass of course. And enormous teats han gingdown.Thetwo guys on the radio are discussing
                                                                                the latest Bird record. Lover Man. Very approp riate. Quite a pretty face though. Must have been less than 37. Can’t tell with black people they all look alike thatisfrom the white point ofvi ew. Soraethingmotherly about her. Boris is a little scared and nostalgic. Embar rassed might be a better way to put it.
         Suppose Ernest walks in. Or his father and his sister. Everything is possible in a situation like this one. Or simply a neighbor. There’s always some curious female neighbor. Maybe she saw Boris come up the stairs panting like an ox. But Boris does not think that fast and that deeply particularly under pressure. Ernest’s mother is now sitting next to him on the sofa giggling at something the two guys on the radio just said and without any warningshe gives Boris a tremendous clap on the back as though telling him come on man come on baby join the fun. Relax. Poor Boris doesn’t know what to do now. He doesn’t understand this kind of secret language. And when it comes to languages he’s not very sharp. Does he tell her now why he came? Did she guess? Can he control himself if it doesn’t work? These are questions which cannot be answered just like that on the spot. Somebody’s got to help. The discjockey does. A slow record begins to play. A deep voice singing. Deep female voice. Billy Holiday singing / Can’t Get Started With You. Perfect. And before he knows what’s happening the glasses of Bourbon are on the table and he’s dancing with her. Nobody really asked. It just happened. They are dancing rubbing against each other just like the night of the party. She literally grabbed him when Lester came in with his solo and now his left leg is between her knees. How hard he is!
And here we are the two of us ** the three of us *** the four of us **** a year later let us say exactly a year after the boat landed in New York and all of us I * he * we * us got all excited in the subway because the girl with the legs spread apart smiled at us and now 365 days later here I * he* we go again getting all excited with another female a much bigger one this time having converged into one another the protagonist and the inventor—and of course by extension the recorder too it’s unavoidable it had to be and now he can hardly move and she must feel it hard stiff like a stick between
her legs and she does feel it and reacts to it quite accordingly-
--------------------------------------------They begin rubbing
against each other without hardly moving their feet just holding on to each other tighter and tighter breathinghard in each other’s necks and he kisses her neck her hair everything it’s sticky greasy particularly her skin but it's soft he expected it to be rough like her hands her curly hair bothers him it tickles his nose and suddenly he feels like droppingher on the floor and running out of the place into the stairs out into the street running like hell crying but she holds on to him tight so tight ithurts and now he can feel the roundness of her belly against his stomach and before he knows what’s happening he lifts up her dress from behind all the way up to her waist as they go on dancing you might say just shuffling along on the same spot she is completely naked under her dress she’s not even wearing panties just an enormous bare ass and his two hands clutching the fat it*s cool and he holds on firmly on each side she doesn’t even complain spreading it apart a little and he pushes against her and they end up against the wall and She leans back and rubs and rubs faster and faster he can feel the hair from her black jungle against his bone he doesn’t know what to do next how to get his hand to his zipper to get it out and shove it in which could be the logical thing to do next but she helps him with sure fingers and now in his head he sees all kinds of faces — asses ss (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) (o) ssass
Peggy’s face and ass
The girl's face and ass in the subway
and many others but these are the two most specific images in his mind. Not all the faces are white or black. Some are mixed. Mixed crowd you might say. There are other colors too in his head. Lots of pink and yellow.

His eyes are closed now. Tightly closed whenhe feels her hand touching his zipper. But that’s enough to make him come like a river inside his underwear. And then he feels like an imbecile. But he doesn’t move a blink. She doesn’t move either. Waits. Then moves away from him a little and holding on to his hand pullshim gently into the bathroom His pants are down around his ankles now and she is wiping him with an elegant circular motion. Doesn’t take long before he's hard again. He drops his head slowly on her shoulder. Her left shoulder. That’s about right. He sniffles and now shes' stroking the back of his head. Passes her fingers in his hair                             What a spectacle
                      The towel drops down on the floor and she continues to rub in a circular motion withher hands only Once in a while her nails catch his hair. Honey baby honey. She keeps saying Shhs. Shsshhss. Whatever that means. As if somehow she wanted to calm him. It’s OK man. It’s OK baby. It’s OK honey. It’s — -O- -0-
                                    How the hell do we get out of this one? I just can’t drop him right there in the middle and have him miss such a good opportunity in the land of opportunities. Let’s squeeze it in quickly and get it over before somebody comcs In aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa gQ^ out

                                    over her shoulder and he starts counting the pieces of clothing hanging on the string two pairs of woman’s panties size enormous four blouses three T-shirts stockings but he stops can’t count anymore all he sees now is pink and blue pinkish and bluish in front of his eyes and inside also of his eyes when he closes them also some clothes on the edge of the window but he can’t tell what these are mosdy white stuff men’s stuff likely
                       8c8c8c8c8c8c8c&8c8cdc8cQc8cdc8c All that of course doesn’t add much to the scene but it makes it credible &c 8c 8c 8c 8c dc 8c & 8c8c8c8c8c8c8c8c
He feels scupid with his pants down around his ankles butshe pulls them offwithher big feet and then pulls him towards her as she leans against the sink and now she’s literally sitting on the edge of the sink how she’s able to get there is impossible to describe particularly since she never lets go of him and while all this motion is going on he shrinks to nothing a little baby’s penis but when the circular motion of her hand gets going again all around and underneath and her other hand is in his ass then he quickly regains an                                      unexpected fullness and his
big hardness and his lengthness and strengthness slide in like a spoon a pin in sour cream it’s wet like hell in there and he can see his visage grimacing at him in the little mirror above the sink the sour cream image is just an image he doesn’t think about it it’s just a sensation a wet                                sticky sensation afeelingbut
poor Boris has never felt                                  anything like that nothing
as exciting ever happened to him before and it’s understandable if one remembers that he’s only 19 no by now a year later he is now 20 years old and it’s not the end a few minutes more and it’s Boris who is now sitting on the sink it’s his turn to be on the edge with his legs hanging down how he got there is also impossible to define
But what is certain is that it’s cold under his ass now she is down on her knees in front of him sucking like a machine saliva oozing a long stream of it from the comers of her mouth as she keeps moving                   and            twisting her head round and
round never in his life has Boris felt so stupid particularly with his skinny legs hanging from the edge of the sink and his pants and underwear all rolled up in abundle on the floor and his two hands yes both of them resting flat on top of her head his shirt tails tucked under rolled under rather
This time he really screams but the scream doesn’t come out no it’s stuck inside his throat                                                                        It is  simply
a muffled sound which would have been a cty had it come out of his throat but it doesn’t                                                                       it doesn’t
had it come out it would have been something like Wow Stop Stop you mothersucker even though he rarely uses that kind of language Stop!
He’s heard that expression before and in this kind of situation one might easily be carried away indeed under such pressure he could do what he has never done before curse in English and use such an expression without shame and possibly many others too that may be shocking in a normal situation but faintly remembered what finally comes out bursting through his lips are entirely different words words at the very least symbolic in such a situation if not very meaningless
%■ STOP YOU MOTHER ! STOP DARLING -c-
M         MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM        O
O                                         M
M — MA MA M — MA - - - MMMMMMMM — MA - --MOMO
Afc this point all sorts of possibilities are possible.
                                                       He could pass out.
He could die of an epileptic fit.
                                 He couldstartscrewinghersohardshe starts screaming so loud all the neighbors come rushing in and find them sitting on the sink in a rather embarrassing situation.
                                                               But instead
he doesn’t say anything and she doesn't say anything.
                                                                    Instead
his hips begin to sway slowly back and forth.
                                                 Finally he lifts her up from the floor holding on to her by the armpits and she’s back on the sink and he slides in again into the juicy sour cream her enormous thighs wrapped around his waist his two hands smashed against the cold porcelain of the sink under her ass but the worst are his knees as he pushes in they almost give under him and her fingernails enter into his flesh yes she does have rather long fingernails no question about that he can feel them deep in his skin the skin of his ass and it hurts.
                                        The thick curly hair of her African jungle feels funny against his belly.
                                                 This time he can’t take it
anymore.
           His knees are folding under him.
                                                 He presses in.
                                                             One last good
time hanging on to her as though he was sliding down a cliff.
                                                                   One last
good time.
           Luckily she’s holding on to him too.
                                                 In fact she’s literally
lifting him up from the floor.
                                 He could have broken both legs and arms if she were to let go of him and let him fall down from the cliff’into the white precipice of reality.
fe-                         In   situations such as these Boris does not
think very fast.
                  Little quick thoughts do go through his mind but it’s a
mess.
                                  MESSMESSMESSMESSMESSMESSMESSMESSMESSMESS
                                                                                 And then he starts laughing aloud just like that first it begins in his head He hears a little laugh growing louder and louder a funny kind of little giggling But when it comes out it’s an explosive laugh But it quickly disintegrates eventually into a series of never-heard-before-little-laughingcoughshard to describe Whatgoes on in the back of his throat whatever comes out of his throat is more like a grunt than a laugh though he's certain he felt the laughter right there is his throat in his mouth ready to burst He can hear ifciaside ofhim coming up like a stream of saliva a little staccato laugh growinginto an enormous disgustinghowl!

'■As
 In situations like these it’s as though the mind becomes a camera taking pictures of itself even though the eyes are closed most of the time the pictures engraved on the inside of the head but the pictures in his head at this time depict his trousers and underwear lying on the floor all crumbled up and Ernest’s mother’s huge ass sitting on the sink and the feeling of is knees getting weaker and weaker but the latter is no t rally a picture but a feeling and of course feelings are not visual they are strictly abstractions or sensations and therefore cannot be depicted so that it is impossible to see the feelings in Boris’ mental pictures all you can see there is Ernest’s mother all around him and him inside of her insider her huge cunt and once more he whispers maman in French as he feels a last drop or perhaps two last drops drip slowly inside of her from the end of his shrivelled reddish prick and now it’s all over finished!
A door slams shut and little footsteps are heard in the staircase quickly he grabs his trousers and underwear and two seconds laterhe’s back on the sofa finishing his Bourbon as though nothing has happened and she’s back in order however with her it was easy all she had to do was to stand up and let her dress fall down and ni vu ni connu Boris concludes but feels he should say a kind word
Yes something nice to her anything before leavingfor now he’s inahuriy to get the fuck out of therey ethe just can’t say thank you and leave it at that!
He has to say something nice and more appropriate and so he quickly tries to think of something to say when she comes out with a loud cry You honey baby doll and grabs him again by the shoulders and presses her thick lips on his trembling lips he frantically pulls away and moves past her towards the door but again she grabs him from the back this time kissing him fat kisses in the back ofhis neck her hand all over his face to the point where he can hardly breathe anymore but finally she lets him go saying shussh shussh and adding You come again yeayou hear Don't forget she has to say something like that or else the whole situation falls apart so he says yes
The stupid things a guy says when he doesn’t know what to say—unbelievable! Boris is convinced he will never come again but one never knows he might quite likely not be
able to resist particularly when stupidly out of nowhere he says to her as he goes out the door Darling I love you just like that unconsciously But he said it not me—that’s for sure I love you darling—imagine that! That was not necessary but he had to say some thing and that’s the only words that came to his mind in this most distressing situation and in a way it’s rather fabulous that he was able to say something like that it’s also quite revealing and when she hears those fabulous words she grabs him once again right there in the middle of the staircase and smacks another big juicy kiss on his trembling lips her tongue shoved all the way inside his mouth and here they go again feeling each other without any reservations and this is how the scene finally ends even though it’sa bit repetitious and somewhat immoral and disgusting but of course when the time comes Til clean it up a bit and leave out all the dirty details and also I’ll change the names I’ll work on it for four days!
Four boxes of noodles and you’ll have the whole motherfucking scene in shape!
It’ll be good for both of us Boris and I because when you're alone in a room you need that kind of excitement that kind of entertainment you have to face the facts and solve your own problems it’s a matter of survival however difficulties may arise for eventually you will have to explain how eventually Boris explains to Ernest what he did with his mother it’s the kind of secret he will not be able to keep to himself and that’ll be quite a confrontation because undoubtedly Boris will feel shitty as hell with Ernest the fist time he seeshim again after this scene that is to say the following day though personally I would not give a damn but Boris is a very sensitive and honest person and so how then will he be able to look at Ernest squarely in the face but fortunately for Boris he has a whole day to recover and compose himself and that gives us a few more boxes to work out the details of the crucial confrontation but if Boris had known how shitty he would feel afterwards he would not have screwed her!
                     In fact if Boris had known what was in store for him in the hollow of his fate he would not have come to America or at least he would have remained in the subway because in a symbolic manner the subway scene represents the center of the discourse the point around which all persons and things gravitate or as stated above The Belly of America source of life and death
                                                                                                                                                                   yet

                                  y of Ernest’s mother in many ways is also like the belly of Ame
it is part of the convergence system in this discourse whereby everything that moves eventually moves towards the same point and therefore in a symbolic way everything comes out the same in the end and consequently everything persons things animals in the discourse ultimately merges and coincides into itself and thus everything that increases also decreases because in a system of double or nothing everything that is doubled or duplicated is automatically erased or negated for indeed everything that produces a forward movement also produces a backward movement and therefore what is said can also be unsaid because what is said is never really said since it can be said differently or as a great thinker once said out of despair je finirai bien parfermer ma salegueule saufpr4uu in French obviously but of course the same can be said in English by an English speaking person as long as he knows what he is saying since all languages coincide
the one you get is better than the one you do not get or the one you dream about but undoubtedly the girl in the subway was much better than Ernest’s mother she was younger and had better legs better teats and a much more exciting ass not as big it’s true but much firmer but an a s s is an ass and Boris always takes them as he finds them without making a big fuss about their bigness or their roundness or their color and this is how eventually he was able to compromise and even justify 4p.himself the rather immoral act he had committed when he screwed his best friend’s mother and in fact he used the same argument to convince Ernest explaining to him that nothingis really immoral in the world if you work out a system that justifies your actions a system based on the law of averages and onsome vague future relationship but
                                                                therefore
                                              belly for belly
this matter is entirely out of context, at this point and may never be resolved in this disclosure because first we are running out of time and of space and second because itis very difficult if notimpossible to relate exactly word for word and step by step what goes through a guy’s head while sitting in the subway or in front of a sheet of paper looking between a girl’s legs while on his way to the end of his story the first day he arrives in America after having suffered a great deal in Europe during the war indeed all this is very difficult to relate in a coherent form and yet if one makes an effort and tries very hard to approximate what goes onin the mind of a guy like Boris and of course what goes on there goes on in French then it comes out approximately something like the following which is an original and unexpurgated version that can be called Thoughts and Images Out of the Mind of Our Protagonist:

And now we are nearing our end. Much more remains to be said
                                                                                                       Much more remains to be prepared
And no doubt much of it will never be said
                            will never be prepared               except perhaps
in some other version of our lives.
                                     Yes!               Poor Boris it had to be
                                     Everything must be plausible
                                                                And Dominique! I don't like Dominique. I've never liked Dominique
                                                                Too effeminate not Jewish enough you can't avoid the facts
                                                                But we must forget that about the Jews the Camps and about the Lamp
                                                                                                                                            s

                                                                                                                                            s

It's a rare thing.
So therefore back with Boris
                                                                             back in the subway scene. He only follows her in his mind:
mentally — ideally — abstractly — dreamily.
Happens all the time.      Meanwhile Uncle David woke up in his seat.
                                                                        He
                                                                                                                                         gets
                                                                        up
They must have arrived. That's possible. Must be 249th Street.
If there is such a stop. It was a long and exciting ride.
And now the afternoon with the Jacobsons is about to begin:
         It was after lunchhowever when they arrived there the female from next door was already there waiting for the nephew from Europe What a bitch Boris doesn't remember if he had had lunch but it really doesn't matter much because that day what a day! he wasn't very hungry in fact he wasn't hungry at all just sick inside lonely and very apprehensive and so confused after the boat the pier and particularly the subway ride with the girl and the legs spread apart therefore at this pointhereally doesn't caremuch about eatingnoodles.
Therefore one more meal
or one meal less so many guys starving in the world and no doubt sometimes alone in my room there will be days when I won't feel like eating at all and I should avoid as much as possible talking about food or else I will go crazy with my noodles and tomato sauce once in a while and if I skip a box one day I might go wild the next and devour three or four boxes all at once!
That would really throw off the whole system—the whole temporal system.
Three boxes at one sitting and there goes the day/box relationship
                                and also the box/day relationship
Zoom!
Yes—definitely—avoid as much as possible talking about food - particularly no-odles-
And yet there are so many good things to eat so many good things I love I adore eggs for breakfast -1 love steaks -1 have a passion for beans -
$k>ve orange juice in the morning - atallglassoforangejuicenothing
                                     like it to clear your throat after all the cigarettes during the night andalsoduring theday two packs -
I shouJd make a looooonnng list of all the tilings I love:   food, -
                                                           women -books -money -movies -

Boris’ story but it could be useful eventually. Then in my room alone
cookingmy daily box ofnoodleseverymorningoneboxforthe whole day
Icouldremember eggsforbreakfastsunnyside- scrambled* soft boiled
it would give me visions hallucinations and I would suffer like hell and
because of the suffering things would come out much better much deeper
                              I can already see myself after three or four months 107 days let’s say with a beard down to my waist dirty like a pig the room smelling like a shit hole crap all over debris of paper spoiled paper!
Dammit how about the paper? Yes the paper how many reams do I need? I almost forgot about that and there must be so many other things I forgot to think about to plan prepare anticipate calculate so many things I have not yet tackled should make a list immediately of all the things I have not yet considered but which eventually must be considered if we want this story to make sense even if we never get to these things paper is one of these
crucial things of course------* I can already see myself------after
two or three months---------with my beard down to my belly----------
doesn’t grow that fast--------then just down to nowhere-----------full
of lice-------I can see myself dreaming of a huge rare steak-----------
a filet mignon---------bloody rare----------to the point of chewing
any thing I can get-------anything I can get my teeth on--------paper
------rags----------leather---------pieces of wood---------dead flies
------like in the camps —■ — maybe one should consider having
a little reserve of something to chew on in moments of despair---------
-  candy for instance---------I love candy---------better yet----------
chewing gum------------that's good for chewing---------and it passes
the time too--------this way I won’t have to chew all the crap I can
get my teeth on--------paper--------rags---------leather--------dead
flies------pieces of wood---------it gives you something to do between
meals----------------------------------------------------between boxes-and it also keeps you from smoking
too much---------and also it helps you along when you’re stuck with
a scene-------the more you chew the more rhythm you get inside
------for instance if I am stuck with the scene where Boris explains
to Ernest what happened with his mother------------what a difficult
scene this will be--------then I can chew a few pieces of gum----------
-  Ernest and Boris met the following day as they had agreed to meet
------Ernest doesn’t suspect anything but he notices how Boris
avoids looking at him straight in the face---------and finally Boris
tells him what happened---------with all the details---------between
friends it’s normal they should tell each other everything-------you
motherfucker he screams---------but soon calms down--------------and
Boris begins his explanation about his theory that nothing is really immoral as long as you work out a system that justifies your actions
------but before he can finish his explanation Ernest punches him
in the mouth---------I have never seen so much anger in a guy------
-  my mother---------he cries out---------anybody even my sister
would have been alright---------but my mother--------imagine that!
He stopped shouting for a moment thinking of what to say next and then he came out with this fabulous expression: You dirty little bastard! Borishad never heard such an outburst. But Ernest had hardly pronounced those words that he realized what he had just said. In a way he was the little bastard because somehow Boris had substituted himself for his father temporarily it’s true. And so they quickly made up and Ernest told his friend: “You know something man, that makes us almost brothers.” And then for a moment he reflected about what he had just said, and then added quite candidly, “no, that’s not really it, that makes me almost your son.” Boris almost fainted when he heard that. Unbelievable the
things a guy can say after he finds out that his best friend screwed his mother. How do you work this one out? How do you reconcile such ambiguous relationships into friendship? It won’t be easy. But a good piece of chewing gum in a situation like this one and that should keep me going to the end of the scene or at least until I can’t take it anymore and give up the whole scene
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Chewing gum then it’s agreed. Five cents a pack of five sticks.
A pack a day?
That’s 365 times 5 that’s 1825 sticks
                                                  and also 1825 cents that’s obvious.
Of course I don't have to count the sticks.         Packs is simpler.
I don’t even have to multiply.                      Simply 365 packs.
But you still have to multiply 365 by 5 to get the price for your list.
Fi ve cents a pack multiplied by 365 gives us 1825 exactly what we said.
But to simplify matters and come out in dollars you drop the last two digits or else you put a period between the first tow digits and the last two            and that gives you a total in dollarsin other words what you
have arrived at is 18 point 25          $ 18.25 for chewing gum      it's a
tjpt of cash for chewing                          I may have to cut down on
something else                                               cut down on
cigarettes that’s the best place           I should be able  to manage  it.
More chewing but less puffing
Less puffing and more chewing!
 I could of course cut down on the paper yes the paper for writing the damn thing if I’m careful and I don’t waste coo much of ic I can play with che paper cut down by one or two reams ic’s true I haven’c calculated the paper
 yet bur eventually I’ll have to it’s quite obvious but let’s calculate with cigarettes
                                                   for the time being if a carton of cigarettes cos cs $3.80 as I decided earlier plus the tax of course 6 cents tax for a cotal of 3-86 then ifl divide 18.25by 3.86 I’ll have the number of cartons that muse be sacrificed for the chewing gum is it worth the sacrifice or shall I skip the whole thing in any case it comes out 4.728 cartons of cigarettes itwouldindeed besimplertodo without chewing gum but the more you chew the better you are and die less you smoke you’ll feel better in the long run pardcularlysinceyoucan’tsmoke
 and chew at the same ame supposedly therefore it’s a deal we sacrifice 4.728 cartons
                                                   of cigarettes for chewing gum however itwill have to be rounded off to 5 becausc it’s impossible to sacrifice an uneven number sohere we go 3.86 multiplied by 5 gives us the sum of 19.80 to spend on chewing gum now if 365 packs cost 18.25 for 19.80 we can get 396 packs of gum which is more of course than one pack per day since we have only 365 days to consider but we’ll solve this problem later for che time being let us simply say that we now have396 packs ofgumSpearmint of course it lasts much longer
Dentine is not bad either I could
mix flavors costs the same and
sometimes it comes in mixed
bags and mixed colors looks beautiful in the drugstores.
Could you please give me 396packs of chewing gum1
                                           I can see the guy’s face.
What flavor?                                   396 packs!  - he’s  crazy!
Couldn’t you make it an even number? 396 is an even number. No
I mean like 400 packs. Are you going into some kind of business? No
It’s just for a party. A huge chewing party won’t believe me. No
HI tell him it’s for an experiment. Fm a scientist trying to           Do
some experiment which has to do with the chewability of chewing gum Or
better yet with the durability of chewing gum.                         OK
but the best would be to buy a few packs at a time.           10 or 20 No
body can question 10 or 20 packs. You’llhavetomake eachpiece
                                           last chew each piece to its utmost squeezingall the juice out before you throw away the used piece to start chew ing another brand new one
Has anyone ever calculated the chewability of a stick of gum? No
i^jnean the chewing durability of a stick of gum. How long can you chew the same piece before it feels like a rubber band in your mouth?
                                                          You could experim ent with this probl em for a little while just to see what hap pens in the end and see how far you can
                                                          go on one piece.....           Three hours?
course on the durability of one piece.
Since there are 24 hours in a day no question about that—even if I work with the curtains closed and you divide 24 by 6 periods six makesit come out even thenyouhave 8 chewingperiods in a 24hour day however since a guy cannot chew while he sleeps and I assume that I will have to sleep—8 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period sounds like a right number—in between the working periods then I won’t be able to chew steadily for 24hours of course some days I will sleep more and others I will sleep less if s inevitable—and some days I’ll sleep all day but on the average Til sleep approximately 8 hours a day then it leaves me 16 hours a day for chewing gum but only if I chew continually and of course a great deal of the chewing process will depend on the mood I am in the excitement of creation will carry me on and I may find myself working straight on for three days without sleep typing straight on for 64 hours but if we assume that everything is normal and that I’m awake 16 hours a day and asleep 8 hours then I have 16 hours for work as well as for chewing and since there are 5 sticks of gum in a pack but before I do that I must take away one hour for meals—one hour a day for eating my noodles that should be time enough—and of course one cannot be chewing gum while eating noodles—or for that matter while drinking coffee or brushing your teeth—though it could be done—but let us say one hour total for my three feedings—that makes it an even 15 hours left for chewing gum and since there are 5 sticks in a pack if I divide 15 by 5 it comes out to 3 hours of chewing per stick now 396 packs times 5 gives me a total of 1980 sticks at my disposal and if I multiply 1980 by 3 then I have the number of chewing hours available during the 365 days in the room all alone 1980 times 3 makes 5940 chewing hours however there will only be a total of5485 hours for work and chewing in the 365 days you
                                                                                                Seven hours? The easiest would be to
                                           divide the day into chew ing periods of five or six hours each depending of
arrive evidently at that figure by multiplying 365 by 15—365 being the number of days and 15 the number of working or chewing hours in each day which gives me a difference of455hours or rather an excess of455 hours it’s no good Somehow that extra 455 hours must be accounted for or rather disposed of we could easily say that those 455 extra hours of chewing would correspond to the number of sleepless hours I will spend when I won't be able to sleep because the tension will be building up more and more towards the end I could easily chew faster and more towards the end thus consuming the excess 455 hours in a matter of a few days or weeks and this would permit me to use up my entire stock of chewing gum during the 365 days
But in any event its decided and no argument about it add gum to your I

at the price of $19.80
and later we shall see how much we come out
          we shall see how much is left of the original 1200 bucks or so 1200 bucks with which we originally started to speculate eventhough nobody really knows where the money came from and it might never be revealed
In any event I should go back to my list just to see where I now stand since everything must be ready on time but of course the room is the most important a room with a view and horses flying horses on the wall paper horses to count in moments of despair and all the supplies piled up in the center of the room very surrealistic and
                                                                                                              me against the world against the walls
    against everything or rather in spite of everything                A
long period of reflection and sequestration all alone!                 A
man has to reach a point when he turns inward
                                          inward my skull         Devour

And of course there’ll be all sorts of miscellaneous things I have not even thought about yet like pencils and possibly a pencil sharpener erasers if I decide to erase some of the things I have written and possibly a razor with razor blades should I decide to shave occasionally if the beard begins to itch which means shaving cream also and aspirin for the headaches but of course the big expensewillbe the paper reams and reams ofwridngpaper because a lot of it will be wasted on first second and third drafts and also on final drafts I should have also a few extra ribbons for the typewriter it is unbelievable the things a guy forgets and I have hardly begun definitely

                he is                                                         easily d
              you are                                                         r
                                                                                                                                                 o
                                                                                                                                                 P
                                                              the .01 to make it easier 8c simpler
So 8 0 7 even
                                                                            this is not all — to this one must add the cost not yet calculated of:
miscellaneous....................................................easily    100 bucks
paper............................................................easily    200 bucks
emergencyfund....................................................easily     25 bucks
But of course I’m only guessing it could be more or it could be less but one cannot take chances particularly since I am not sure we started with an even 1200 dollars that figure was never clarified nor certified what is certain however is that there was not more than 1200 and more likely less so it's no use getting all worked up in advance since it might not work out in the end!
particularly if I made a little error in my calculations along the way which, is quite possible but even if I am guessing the cost I am not too far off because if I can spend over 200 bucks on cigarettes as we have shown then it is quite possible to spend 100 bucks on noodles as previously calculated then I can easily spend around 200 bucks for paper because eventually noodles andpaper will coincide in fact paper may prove even more important than noodles coincide thus if on the one hand I'll consume noodles on the other Til consume paper
therefore noodles and paper like everything else in this discourse will coincide in the end just as days and boxes coincided in the beginning for indeed everything comes out the same take it all or leave it all
                           Double Or Nothing
but originally we said 8 bucks a week for the room that’s what we said in the                                                                     B
                                                                                                                                      e
          Remember: just think for instance if ...etc.... etc....          g
                                                                                                                                       i
and it came out to 416 dollars for the room                                n
                                                                                                                                      n
However suppose the room does not cost 8 dollars a week                    i
          suppose the room costs only 7 dollars a week                     n
                                              7 dollars for a room         g
it’s possible
                           then 7 times 52 makes only 364
                                                                                                                      364 for the room
Imagine that!
                                                             that means that you now have 52 dollars 416 less 364 leaves 52more
to work with..............and therefore we have to start all over again
It’s quite obvious:
Just think........for instance.....if the room costs only 7 bucks a week...
7 times 52 makes 364...
         Then
              it
             does
             not
        necessarily
            have
              to
              be
 NOODLES!
